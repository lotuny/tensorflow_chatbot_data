inb4 the "i told you so" video
you lead with a 10 year old story that is pathetic &amp; you do it because you are paid for by clinton campaign
judging out of hand, i know, but doesn't seem to me these ppl have the understanding to analyze plan
more than that. thinks americans should not be allowed decide trump should be potus.

who knows, with a little luck? the next bb or rk is already in the works 💪
and ufc. and chippers.
4/ after this election, hindenburg made hitler chancellor, germany democracy died, and then millions of others.
5/ it is terribly naive to believe our 240 years of democratic government is never threatened by demagoguery.
regardless how it was attained though those young men made a very wise choice with the assistance of their attorneys

we do have very good experience in wordpress. we have designed &amp; developed several wordpress sites.
build that wall!!! xenophobia ain't never hurt nobody!!!
censorship? or just an error? what's missing?
you can’t make just social use of any of this science until you jettison the binary language. and that’s hard to do.
trump is a disease worse than anyone knows and he must be wiped from the brow of a mesmerized nation.
we want to stay high off fantasy and rap and entertainment world is el chapo
so it's important to learn how to say sorry, and even more important to learn how to be sorry. how to soothe instead of silence.
bernie sanders is funny. he folded like a cheap lawn chair to the "criminal clinton machine"!

jewish people faced racist, nazi imagery from the son of a presidential candidate who is supported by nearly half of americans, and--
haha! hope you've had a good week. breakfast time here in nyc. have a great weekend 😊
right and they don't have to earn that. they just stand around like a show horse
but is indicative of the atmosphere, where a woc questioning racism is "worse" than politely not questioning racism. that was just one day.
good hair days are not-so-small joys 💆🏾
not in yonkers right ?
happy friday❤️
the man who said he would never vote for a woman for president, has gone to jail and has 7 children is a political figure now?
trump's sociopathic narcissism is incurable &amp; threatens u.s. security. he is a traitor!
if you were on the ticket, with the exception of a few nba team loyalists, we might have approached a unanimous, potus landslide.
hrc supports monsanto.☠💰

well that's lame. apple can never leave something alone. always making things more difficult.

no. the show should be historically accurate.
thank you so much!
you lead to a brilliant summation, but your error is ascribing trumpism as a leftist phenomenon. it's as right wing as it gets.
why instead of on amazon?

his support base is nationalist, but really, if you compare a guy like trump to hitler, you really need to read up on hitler's career.
i agree. i vote by mail and often wonder if mine is even ran though the machine
omg, everything is closing! i thought this party went till 1am!
i'm not voting for trump because he's a compulsive liar and he needs aides to manage his twitter feed, not because he's hitler.
and bro chance is blowing up like crazy, i was lucky enough to see him live at outsidelands 🙌🏻

does facebook actually make you prove your name is what you say it is?
bingo! trump supporters don't really care if he is ignorant, classless and unstable. he has personality! rogue chic.

trump supporters i've talked to irl seem far more reasonable than people hired to be professional tv supporters
wow really lit into kellyanne she couldn't take it.
it's not like the laws aren't there. but when expensive lawyers can effectively opt you out of legal penalties - hi, wall street - it's bad.

trump is a grand wizard in prada shoes. he's a disgusting vile waist of oxygen
this was an interesting caption-picture juxtaposition
great production! saw it this summer while visiting london. loved it. so topical in the times we live in.
looking good as always but you tagged the wrong lol
. corruption can happen in any system, socialist democracies and multiparty systems included.

thanks man, still can't beat me in madden tho
they do both. first print the lie, then call it out as fact check. you decide they say, that's fair and balanced
you are smarter than this. trump is a liar can't you see that?
cc we gotta pod this

i was never really part of that scene but that property of it is really cool and definitely a loss now.
"tax amnesty" is a fine term for certain policies, just not for a repatriation holiday.
i thought iphone tweets were all staffers?
you’re gonna love israel! it was so amazing when i visited last november. have a great time!
yeah &amp; lie but &amp; random alt-rw bloggers speak the truth. you sound sane.
that racism was part of clinton's 2008 campaign. which is why i cannot support hrc or trump. why are we only talking about trump?
i notice that people who cannot argue points move to insults instead
and, it's absolutely true, they've been violent
that 1 post is more than trump has accomplished (for others) in his lifetime.
lol was just a joke trying to pass time at a 5yr old soccer game

finally someone understands (as much as possible)
d. trump is assassinating american democracy we know &amp; is dangerous to boot, ashamed of americans who would vote for a traitor
uses isis tactics.
ok but you're literally a rapist
if people think you kicked me in the groin, but i grab my gut in response... you didn't hit the groin.
you are so sad. voting for trump will destroy our country. you sound ill informed. shame on your voting for a rapist
big man, jeremy, not going down!!!
only if she is being handcuffed. in that case i would love to have her back.
gotta learn the system
his game won't transition but he got time to develop
. fact-checking is not silencing. would love to hear more from trump like his tax returns.
i'm having one of those moments here:

not even sarah paulson or scarlett johansson in an ss uniform can make it anything but a struggle to get through.
thank you for hustling me to relapse with my gambling addiction.
and bernie wants you to vote hillary. so maybe your trust isn't all that strong. purity over reality?
pre order was a must! got my 7 plus yesterday and didn't have to wait on any crazy lines for it.
to think i enjoyed reading this guy once
just want everyone to think about it 🍆
see it's ppl like you that show stuff like this &amp; ur lies…you can go to the devil i'm sure you 2 will get along splendidly!
well, the dutch engineers did. 😏 i agree, though. people always push the limits. regardless of mode, of course.
looks delicious though.
head so big it blocked the score board 🤔
why do you say that
but your excitement wasn't what came through... your anger was. that's hurtful.
nice! thx :)
if you're referring to something that happened on twitter, anyway. (i'm just guessing from the other day.)
lol what a fucking clown
exactly lol stats can be inflated in that regard. like asante was a ball hawk but he also got beat frequently for gambling
yes. your point on placement is true but doesn't explain y's 30min avg view time. look at tencent+nba. massive .
holy shit thats so nice wtf i ❤️ you
yw. what you're describing sounds more like a "legal project manager", ideally someone w/legal exp and pm training
lmao wow i forgot about hoot ass kevin kolb
"this is a factor of 50 smaller than voids inherent in rubber, hiv can readily pass through condom"

this isn't really true
let's remember, as kellyanne conway has said, donald trump doesn't engage in personal insults.
i don't hate vocal effects. they're cool. just tired on every single track.
i'm all for entertainment, but this is someone who wants to detract from the well being of good peoples' lives... ?
you don't want to be under the intense iterrogation lamp, believe me! holy cruel and unusual punishment, batman!
thanks for all the info — we've referenced in an article about what we know so far:

what happened?
my research indicates one post linking to a bbc alert, no ny post story. after that is was "shit...suggestions"...no source.
at least they were covering it. cnn and msnbc were in obamas speech.
the trump kids ain't very artikyoooolit. donald donated $40,000 to 1 son's college to keep him from being tossed.
yeah you definitely have a point, but i think it goes farther than just the right.

no, i just think it's important to wait for official word rather than dive into assumptions.
there seem to be lots of "isolated " incidents where racism was part of hillary's 2008 campaign.
you're bullshit
pascal certainly does, and rues it as well.
i know it's crazy, also it was another bombing in seaside heights, nj. people r losing their mind!

im not media - i'm more disgusted with trump than just about anything. . .including the explosion. . .
three guys and twenty-five girls
they fiddle while america burns.... but no threat of terrorism. ugh
not 4 more minutes! her husband has brought this country down economically and on the world stage! bye bye obamas
there is no one definition of terrorism true but most include broader around behind just scaring or injuring people
she looks tired and sick to me (pneumonia, remember?) and she's flying, which isn't always good for people with blood clots.

wonderful news
awesome idea. my mind reflexively imagined a zodiac-ish dynamic with poe (a la downey) drinking himself to death. too dark?
... or "intertwining". something like that
i'd add we're always more @ risk frm texting drivers than exploding dumpsters,but trump~

and how it ended up at 4am
twitter provides a great opportunity with every tweet to ask yourself if phrases are pulling their weight in semantic meaning.
…or if phrases and sentences are being expended in order to divert attention away from a lack of justification for whatever's being argued.
very reasoned points, mark. shame all wanted to do was talk about the lords, which her party refused to reform.
haha. only for a bit dear
“taxing and spending” is basically what the government does. it's a pretty good tl;dr, even if we've moved from tariffs to income taxes.

without question
idea of feeling safe in the world is an anacronym.

the "ribbon of light"!!! sure vanness, sure
could be president that he agreed with you.
yeah, sorry didn't really register what you were saying last night! thank you, we shall c
i hear that insurance companies, the middleman between patients &amp; providers, have been doing well for decades.
it's sad you take a word like gay bashed - something that is real and belittle that word.
--- bowery boys were a weekend staple (on kbhk 44) back in the 80's, right along side abbott and costello.
none stop deluding yourself with fabricated lies to brainwash you

you're right! better times!
and, even if they do, if the three-way tie breaks against them, they still could be out.
thank you 😘 god bless u din
feeling safe in the world is an anacronym. trump caters2that fear.
what sticker pack
because he's nothing but a professional conman brainwashing his flock!
for retail? no way lol
always thought rule of thumb was ball isn't moving, thus "dead". that ball is still rolling

i heard a rumor of something like that in the works for next year up here in ny. new sanctioning body for "thruway corridor"
my granddaughter danced at the fair also. i couldn't make it out there but i know you both did great! blessings to all!
a win for all! less noise!
i'd say nyc is under attack
here we go again, the 3rd grade name calling and bashing a respected american.
but.. but...but....hillary is the liar
would be to trump's advantage for more "attacks" to happen between now and election day. makes one suspicious.
this seemed like a real amateur job- literally a pressure cooker hooked up to cell phones. but it was the same type that went off on 23rd
omg hales ily imy 💘😭 also what is that b&amp;w pic 😂
everyone who thinks donald trump is anti semite needs to watch this!
that'd be awesome!
yes! the conservative moment would just fold up its tent! come on now. nobody has absolutely crushed anybody for 30+ years.
i'm disturbed
cynicism is just nihilism with a lesser degree of asshole type
i never said those exact words. drink some coffee 😂😂😂

no doubt direct needs to be done with more efficiency, but pubs have little choice to regain control
duh i see you are in toronto! amazeballs! you all moving all the time-- r u taking photos? hyuno curating?
what the hell is wrong with you? thinking one fucking candidate stops this? and trump at that? trump only increases the violence
i just dismissed it because i know the "source".
i'm having trouble keeping up with these massive multi-player twitter convos.
if you search chloe lukasiak there's even more!
it was weird instead of seeing black everything started getting whiter and whiter. i had to force myself to wake up smh
you got that right! for the kids and in order for our country to survive
lots of domestic terrorists have used bombs as well. (eric robert rudolph, timothy mcveigh.)
are you talking about the logic behind google maps or apple maps?
prediction: 5 minutes on the facts of the bombing and 45 minutes on "islam is peace."
and he called trump a disgrace &amp; international pariah don't forget that tell the whole story
you may be right that many americans would choose against their best interest because they "don't like" the other.
how cool is that?! happy sunday!
i saw it. think i'm blind as well?
because numbers hurt what's left of their brain.
might drop today might not idk
eggs or cereal for breakfast this morning?
yes we are!
i think it's how many old folks define privacy. they see "kids" posting every moment of their lives on social media. no privacy
same story with the watches, different model (not sure if that’s visible in the hardware id)
hahaha for sure puro effects ang convo 😂

our next president must protect law enforcement or we are doomed as a nation

he evolved over time, but more telling was that he was above the bar for most whites of his era, which is sad in itself.

nothing like brunch to quickly get you off of organized religion!

i know!!! it's terrifying 😱
it is for patients who are covered w medicare advantage
thank you! you too! 💋
i'm not real bro support each other
if you spent more time hunting down terrorists and less time figuring ways to protect all involved with clinton foundation🚨💰👳👈
no i am not. i am clearly pointing out that people will die in a clinton presidency, and those ppl live in the mideast.
just like france and britain. we must be tough and root them out now before they destroy our way of life!
will be live-tweeting?
powerful ad. it shows how this guy (trump) is out of touch with reality. he just does not have clue about anything.
this was a well dressed older woman with a gucci bag throwing f-bombs my way on a sunday am
at least you got to go🙃🙃🙃
it's not being covered up sources close to the investigation
my theory is that he got that from pixar. not sure it applies before his work before rejoining apple (next).
do you hear yourself? arrogant, vain, now expressing my opinion is dangerous. you need to step back and see how you sound.
this is the kind of famous you are to me.
you're definitely right
i told her i got her a snow globe from ca and she said "but it's not david" 😌😜🤓

why the women have to shave their heads and wear wigs after having a child? that ain't fair
i didn't make fun of ur looks, i said u look exactly how i would expect u to look. why would you think of that as negative?
is service in the military the bar you're now setting for being president? where did hillary serve?
everything i want includes a president that is not pro-death penalty, which disproportionately affects black/brown poor americans
fuck you, murderer.
say less bruh i got you when i get back up there!
this girl has me smiling way to early in the morning 😂
let me be hard on social media at least smh
excuse me if i find it funny that you're actually not and you haven't read the bible you attacked me with?

find that scripture it'll make judging others which we shouldn't do (attitudes you talked about) easier
smart man we need to listen to

wr side of the minister feels a connection to the angela/lolita archetype. ag may use that to her advantage.
totally. something was clearly amiss but that specific info wasn't publicly available and they're not saying where he got it
nice work but you won't catch me in that... i asses that clinton is not the candidate i want running the us
i think a candidate that takes money from citi, chase and goldman is ignoring the poor. i know what those banks did to economy.
americas best tits? dd-factor?
mefia props up hillary
any time in the car with you haha this was the one with getting breakfast too 😂
i guess they'd have to catch the #$%&amp; to know. i bet they will. they usually do. lots of cameras.
i will be ok in a clinton presidency. $15 wage doesn't affect me personally, nor do food stamps. that's my point. this isn't about me
the federal reserve act is summoned to this high tech seance too. amid currency and chaos ou est humanite?

(that's what innovation is all about, by the way: when something is not "obviously doable", try anyway, work around the issues.)
not nearly as horrible as cheetonazi &amp; his boys from brazil spawn jr retweeting cesspits.
. that lie/myth has been widely debunked by fact checkers and investigative reporters
it's ridiculous. even the mere suggestion we wait for facts is somehow construed as being "pro-terrorist".
i know, that's the best part
fact; not even with his rhetoric couldn't stop this type terrorist acts . his mouth is explosive.
i feel like one of them won't whiff again this week, but damned if i could pick which.

no, not "appalling", but stupid and without merit. campaign are desperate to change the subject.
one story has pretty lights..
no, fearful speculation occurs. thought involves awaiting evidence and facts before leaping to the worst scenario.
i think we need to rethink our basic kit after seeing these 🔥🔥💯💯
this provides zero clarification unless you say she's wrong. do better.

no, in that sentence it’s a verb used as an adjective. like “burnt” or “eaten”, etc. you use the participle form.
it’s a really common error, probably because in spoken english the syllable coda is reduced and assimilates to the /s/.

horse shoe is a daytime activity
facts are facts. you want to defy the clear choice of gop voters. trump got way way more votes than any other candidate.
um, where does one find this breakfast special?
thank you so very much lover! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
is our only chance for real change &amp; security for the country.
naw i'm on case 5, but i pretty much felt it already.
there's multiple devils in this race. it all sucks.

i agree with judaism and buddhism in a lot of ways. i'm sort of a steve jobs buddhist, you might say. how anyone could be a neo-nazi is wtf.
i don't support companies divesting from israel, even though i think the palestinian rights activists mean well. it's not quite practical.
president bush bailed out wall st and banks instead of consumers..taxpayers were screwed over.

this is actually a really hard realization to stumble upon
wow, your comprehension skills are lacking. but thanks for checking out my profile. i guess you really do care.
what people aren't getting is that donald sees his fantasies as if they are reality. belief is reality.
it's a silent protest. no one notices. it's really just me feeling sad whenever we're supposed to sing about "the land of the free."
when you see the baron remember the tooth!
i'm proud that we live in a country where people can protest. where people braver than me can take risks and tell us to be better.
ugh why are people who ordered after i did getting tracking numbers for their orders and i haven't?

that's insane!!!
i'm really, really trying to get over the whole "i'll get to it" mindset. there's so much to ingest that i end up having it pile up.
of course fox played same game in primaries saying trump had no path to 1237 but cruz did even behind by+400👎👎

mr. trump, you must make a strong statement condemning russian aggression against un civilians.

yup. ratcole and lurch hated nat and wanted her out. vic wanted james out.

literally feel you on a spiritual level bc we commute the same 🙄🙄🙄🙄
this is the greatest
liar. truth is in the images we saw. why was she so frightened of a man, with his hands up, walking away from her? bs.
all add up to a terrifying picture of what kind of consequences that sort of arrogance and disregard for empirical truth can have
why haven't you done anything about it in 30 years? the poverty levels increased after the 96 welfare reform of bill clinton

penny slots built many a casino throughout the world
but you're good with "hey, you look like a ******, get the f*ck out of my store"?
wait let's a take a step back for a minute :p
that's unfortunate. ppl need to put their believes and political affiliations aside. ppl need to think about the human factor.
might as well have the game sliders on! lol
we were till you left me stranded. that's not what friends do.
they don't respect the flag, the nation or what makes us the greatest. our education system is brainwashing them

never enough. greed and out of control capitalism is a drug that addicts, then kills.
my vote goes to neither. nothing could convince me to vote me for 1 of 2 ppl i believe will be the worst president ever.
i've noticed that it seems to reshape my view of the alphabet by introducing new relationships among letters
i think but i'm not sure
at some point new high-profile failures (which netbeans will probably be) hurt all of apache, not just that project.
pleased to make your e-quaintance, heather! ;)

we have received 800k+ refugees since 9/11 &amp; only 5 implicated/convicted of terror activities
agreed! but how to pay for building? seems hard to get developers to pay for affordable housing
diff time to be sure but the cops i worked with 97% were good ppl man w/good intentions. these things are not reflective of
that article gave you a bunch of cites, so why don't you show us some that say otherwise.
no relation to shamwow
a little too negative as framed but i might be able to figure out a way to address in a more positive way
update: the beats are causing *bad* pain to the outer part of my ear to the point that i can no longer wear them. lol back to beyerdynamic.

his snapchat is so entertaining
to clarify, when someone is trying to tell you to be quiet i mean they are either thing to forcefully shut you up or try to bring in factors

thank you n good morning
people your height tend to be that way

i told them that they should have communicated that up front as i did not extend them those terms on the invoice.

parking enforcement?
i feel like it's part overcompensation and part business decision
yay! reconnecting with rob at helped get this show off the ground!
i was on her twitter because she tweeted saying she doesn't trust a fucking "carnist" grooming her dog. how fucking arrogant.
alex tell her im not insane please lol
who should play you in the inevitable biopic?
he's at your front desk.... he is just so painfully slow.... and i just use twitter to complain about how long he takes.
8 years ago i was kidnapped in malaysia &amp; had a gun to my head. killing people out of fear solves nothing.

3/ but i want to highlight a related problem that is, in a way, more fundamental. more cultural.

so many amazing book bloggers of all genders, sexualities, colors, &amp; levels of disability who review books for free. why aren't they hired?
6) that includes the women. they may be badasses, but negans group doesn't know that.
i hear does so much investigative work for no one knows who he is!
especially after pluto was demoted from a planet! :)
but it goes far beyond that. he ginned up (at least the idea of) a floor fight going all the way to the convention
you moved to florida?
there's a lot of symbols tied into memes that teens/kids innoc. don't understand. explain meanings, let kids change
beautiful, bet he's there somewhere
i don't think anything will ever equal emmy as a birthday present. except, possibly, an oscar. 😊
while this is true, those that don't follow the law and those who uphold it don't get to choose not to obey.

ugh im so envious
being black shouldn't give the cops a pass to murder black people.our "tough on crimes" mentality is our ruin
but couldn't you argue that "i love how they look" speaks to the influence of social conditioning? playing devil's advocate
12 - 11 - 10 - 9 -
thank you!!

any idea we can find out the material used for the shirt? can’t see it in the link.
the degree to which us discourse has appropriated the "foreign agent" and fifth column rhetoric, i almost cannot believe it

each level would be built around a single mechanism. and at the start, a modal would appear with 6 words.
you are part of a cult of hatred and perversion.
a handful of times? keep counting. i've got 1,000+. take care.
don't need to read article to know 😅 just need to see my bank balance 😂

they ruled in favor of the defendant and dismissed his case saying he could run from the police if innocent lol
is he offering a specif plan or is that just something he came up with?
i don't care, don't like it when he trashes our country. his whole campaign has been negative and lacks substance
good idea changing it at the last minute from "booty show".
my town requires excuse sadly. so much mail gets lost so don't trust it. nov 8 first one in line.
i really miss the hip hop of the 1990s a lot because of that. mainstream hip hop was an almost unknowing political movement.
yeah the purpose tour is going to go by so quick
that isn't confirmed. folks on the ground said it was a rubber bullet = cops shot him. riot cops escalated violence
it's working out now. sanders only didnt work out because the dnc rigged the primary against him. we're against hrc &amp; trump

as a dav i support that
i'm sure things will get better!

have you forgotten who murdered mlk while being peaceful?
also this contract is only for 500 trucks. they wouldn't say the deal value but it is not something that will move the needle financially
people really need to give yw a chance, i'm so so so happy that i did
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
i would never wear perfume to a meet &amp; greet for that very reason. plus, as fans we wouldn't know if you were allergic.
many lives were saved.
free advice: pull furniture away from windows, wash mold immediately. wear a mask. get rid of rugs. dust mites = allergies
..then they're hurt &amp; they're done❌ ("they be done❌"-twtr shorthand) ur twt is 🔑
so far trump has argued agains the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 8th amendments. so he wants to abolish the enter constitution.

this is why all my beats are on my site the only way to get them is by purchase

the article just said otherwise lol.
green for sure. he is a wr1.
if it were just charlotte, it wouldn't be a major issue. it's systemic! im sure the cops didn't know his record when they shot him
he's fibbing, he would make a 3d replica of his junk and sell it on ebay!
substitute the term "media elites" with presidential candidates and the term "advocacy" with propaganda outlets. thx
additions of frye (shooter) and dunleavey (high iq ball mover) prob help this.
did u need prescription or are those readers? i finally had to break down and by the latter....
fucking white women 😡😡😡

every president comes into office looking like a bright shiny penny, they all leave like a bag of hammered dog crap
i would rule out third party voters exceeding 10% of registered voters who do not vote. i will put money on it.

we all agree on the latter but no one can definitely say bone spurs led to shoulder impingement. different injury.

i've read they spend most of their training on shooting and very little on how to approach a scene.
yo i was a hufflepuff and now i'm a slytherin! wassup with that!?
did you know that they come in different colours and shapes amanda
that's amazing
in chicago they destroyed over 17,000 citizen complaints due to a law the fop supports. no accountability.
so because a black cop shot a black man it's not racism? where do you think anti-blackness stems from?
we stayin up all night
glenn, change your profile pic to the isis flag then try “chop their heads off” and you can tweet all you like 😜

shouldn't the article say *an arrest warrant was issued for shelby*?
but what are chances all five are ready by even may?
trump tries to put a wash over people by insulting the same 3 things about her, and it only comes across as sedate
your patronus is basically nature's jervis cottonbelly. how is that bad?
i love them all ... probably closest with katya, sharon and ivy ?? hard to say
actually we don't have an official language, there are many different languages spoken here in the usa!

10 eggs at a time is much better!

people might be more likely to realize why he's wrong and insane

"yawn c-lark"

yea. they have to prove is that she wasn't in threat when she shot him. no proof of intent needed.
didn't i tell you😅😂😍
that's interesting because it should sound the same -- i just punched up the bass and kick drum.
which led to him being shot. regardless if the officers intentions were racially driven, if keith had been white-
lmaooo must be the xans fuckin wit ya head tommy
both isabela and leliana want to make sure that their friends are getting into a relationship that's good for them. it's sweet.

well i'm a fan of xbox so sorry if that upsets you. but you need to realize xbox is ms's gaming platform on win10 and console

control of scotus is an article of faith among conservatives; among democratic voters, it's taken for granted

they were responsible 4 spreading that false "chair throwing" rumor that pundits used to say sanders couldn't control spprtres

pitch needs to get better numbers but i really liked it, my second fave new show.
the mistake texts are hilarious and you should try them if you have lifebars to spare.
bush sent thousands of americans 2 die in a bogus war that killed half a million iraqis. how the fuck could trump be worse?
that's not even a question. (it's a poll.)
super sexist and just conforming to hegemonic masculinity
it makes white conservatives feel better, like their overt racism is noble somehow
you are in ever-changing form, indefinitely pliable, healer of your own hands, staunch in your flexibility.

what a disgusting racist thing to say. white ppl commit more violence in this country than others
that was day one, every protest march since was peaceful and without incident.
reason why i didn't go out
there's no end to learning new things everyday. :)

i have a bad sprain in my neck and a serious concussion they're keeping me overnight 🤕🤕

the left handles real discussions fine. ultra rw's like you only spread ignorance and lies. banning benefits all.
4 drinks is all it takes? lightweight
i saw that. guns and mental, no good.
🤔 do they not know me or do i not know myself
no, blm is the group that fights against coward cops who are so afraid of little black boys w/bb guns that they shoot them.
oh please. trump is a private citizen &amp; as innocent as a baby compared to &amp; rapist hubby billy.

inspiring! this is how i wake up |..always.
awe haha. i have a hard time with them because their business decisions feel super unsupervised
inspiring or symbolic political expression ?
kasich has destroyed my home state. may he rot in hell and be doomed to play in an intended sandbox infested w/worms
tell them we want voter id law....to protect our most cherished right..
i guess it was fine to bring boy toy to annoy trump, but when challenged it is not cool anymore. are we supposed just to crown her?
why is this news. was trumpter not good in bed.
bare people upset even tho it's got 2 more seasons confirmed
i also care about the amount of sleep going in at 8 is costing me

what does trump have to lose? blacks know his policy provisions will hurt them. hopes to buy off the greedy who are desperate.
i just purchased sunglasses that are bifocals so i can walk outside and see my phone! get her some! stay blessed?
how about we shine a light on obama/clinton, who are responsible for total failure of us policy on syria/putin? humm?

coffee crisp. timbits. a woman? ;)

unbelievable, this is just so tragic on so many levels.
are killed by white officers.
i just asked karsten why is he tight..makes no sense
yes. yes he is
ask his friends. he saying if they win he'll vote for the candidate he hates.
i know i miss you so much 😓 come to me !
i am not. and domesticated animals rely on humans. it’s a symbiotic relationship. and can be done ethically.
it is cuz if they did want safety they'd outlaw that play it's worse than hands to the face or even helmet to helmet imo
beautiful pic!
he really did. the whole film is like an expressionist painting. too bad bad reviews dissuaded him from doing another.
i converted my friend who was strictly a beyhive. i brought him with me last night &amp; now he's a huge fans of you 😏
she is at this baseball game rn.. they just showed her on he kiss cam 😂😂
may we suggest a sun salutations or two instead or maybe both! yoga+oreos

promo cards were for the early launch on 9/14. flgss received 20 cards (&amp; 5 games to sell, and 1 demo copy) to give as they wanted.

darn i missed this. so tired of trump tv, i decided to watch madea for a few laughs.
wow he missed lol
when i came to los angles you guys went to vegas , now that i'm on my way back to vegas you guys are coming back to los angles 🙄🙄
then no one would edit their tweets. plus, what about replies? you could reply to i love ice cream saying "me too" but then
since the vp has already been vetted &amp; accepted by the convention. it's done
i did the challenge today, too! so in sync ☺️
he thinks they evolved into dogs. lol.
so sad! tragic loss!
i guess you don't qualify. 4 dead in benghazi on your watch, you have shown little respect for cops &amp; your lying ways suck
might not, of course, but always could.
no, it's not. it's hurting me and i'm sure thousands of people too. what you're feeling is normal.
you're better than i am. i light people up when they harass people i don't know. i'm petty.
got your back tho
now you are getting mean and petty. daon’t you have any facts?
"i follow her on twitter"
thanks for the help though
funny but probably more true than fiction!
just to confirm. you're endorsing for trump because of taxing the dead and his ability to trick people. correct?
i would love nothing more than to be dignified and graceful at all times.
titans have fans? you could hear raiders chants the entire game.
it was sooooo amazing! great city 😊 fall is really fun there! i love when it's halloween time too

refs don't give raiders anything trust me on that
if you ever want to come visit our team and meet the storage team in person we are very happy to host guests too!
manning face in full force as eli chokes like a dog again!!!

i believe in you 💕 one step at a time 👍🏼
lying to cover their butts over peddling position for foreign and domestic cash!

should have done it when he was popular
summers in santa cruz tend to be socked in with fog. the clouds stick around until noon or so, burn off, then come back around 5 pm.
there's no need for what your doing
i don't either. just saying its a disturbing pattern in policing
the facts clinton needs to know for the are trump fact-checks, since apprentice moderators won't play that role
what a controlled response. polite even. are you ill stevums?
crazy that he left chase out there with those old tires....
*passes out with fingers mere inches from the fan’s “on” switch*
does this reflect more on trump's issues as a candidate or more that hrc reflects far more gop policy than she lets on
thank you sir.
the opening is a fantastic walking tour of lupin history.
he lacks in many areas but he excels at being a bitch
im gonna buy a jacket and a shirt just to fuck with everyone

yes cop in red. body cam released shows cop in red as he ran to k.scott on the ground show no gun. watch his left foot. plants
chargers making gore look like barry sanders
you realize that by using it as a rhetorical device that, almost by definition, means he says it.
he looked great in his two relief appearances. must be a lot of extra adrenaline when it's your 1st big league start.
he hasn't won shit in years (championship wise) and he's literally handed amazing talent
start playing smart team hockey instead of selfish show-off hockey

no, the other protest that makes sense is against electing a corrupt incompetent warmonger hillary to the presidency.
excellent writing ,you summarize ones whole life with underwear and breath odor .
well they can claim no rape if the investigator said "there was no rape" lol. where did you determine they were refugees?
absolutely! .had bunch issues recently w/ la drivers cancel for no reason. then uber robotic replies + slow to remedy👎🏻👎🏻
do you consider this a good part, or a bad part?
those who assert hillary's ruthless self-interest don't get it. civilization, decency, morality on her shoulders.
yes his supporters are the uneducated no one else falls for his bs
isn't it too soon for pumpkin picking?
this only shows your lack of objectivity and logic. it is literally unsubstantiated if you haven't substantiated it.

update: nobody came and they all gradually walked away.
i periodically throw out old projects so i don't have a reveal like this.
actually, that will help trump. he's not going to say stupid things as much as he does normally.
this was an unfortunate turn of events in the phone room.
however, do they come with 5 other siblings, parents and a maid named alice? 😎
such a gentleman i'll bet he takes dishes out of sink before peeing

you don't have to watch the debates but you still should go out and vote, 40-45% voter turnout per election is pathetic

theyre up on the website now!! i ordered last week came pretty quickly!
we all evolve hasn't too!
your winning!!
he tried to stay calm... lasted about 12 minutes lol
is everyone buying drinks or just standing around?
you mean he's trying to bully and intimidate.
you can't even vote
hillary's hair looks tremendous in hd. trump's hair looks like cotton candy with hairspray. is it really a weave?

tea djt cutting tax for the wealthy is great you make me sick
agree but anyone running for president has to border on in this age
finally! didn't think he existed
you and i may see that but the majority of this country isn't smart enough to realize that he's insane
actually it was in the town next door.
is he even fucking there?????
in twisted tea currency yes
pretty sure the country wants a fighter right now but not sure where he's falling on fighter/bananas spectrum
actually, it's brilliant.
this is funny to watch😂
you prefer loud and ignorant?

tear down this wall mr. gorbachev!
and then she should have just kept repeating that over and over again. instead, that tax thing, and "trumped-up trickle down."
tax return yes. again the audit. more bs
the witty tweets make the debacle way more bearable. 😖
ill take the million dollar loan.. if that's what you're asking. but trump can gtfo
question mark indeed
can it not be a trump course?
expect anything less? lol
that's trump has lost the debate
esp since she went on about people being hurt, and he jumped in with "its business."
i didnt think he would be this good!
it's ok cause eminem boutta run 2020
truth. including the two up there?
he's getting angry bigly 😂
what is a regular audit? when is it ending? trump is going to release taxes when it ends? what? who?
i got it! it's the creative team behind avenue q!
trading with china has made it less commie, no?
donald needs to wake up. hillary knows what america needs...donald has no clue!
"i'm the best at getting audited."
has anyone asked if they're really auditing him?
why are you repeating these angry statements... not the story
trump turns questioning on tax returns into "i make $684 million vote for me"
i literally went to twitch to check like 5 minutes ago
nice work sir. nice work.
are you blind? he's acting like a fucking phyco
that's all he does
it's the lawyers. not him.
how are you tweeting if your in the middle of a live debate? 🤔
he has words, he has the best words
no irs is simply chewing on it via audit..
obama didn't die for this.
the difference between other audits and yours mr trump is that you're running for president
this is even more true today, adel, than when einstein even stated it! :) thanks for sharing! regards.
these are trump supporters. apparently like him, the rules don't apply to them
people would freak out if it happened. but this would be a good thing.
haha right? clinton and trump are taking over
- i think the clock is broken😜
you are so right
shut up no one likes you
honestly! 😭
"hillary clinton should disclose her goldman sachs speeches " would have been a better answer.
haha yeah i agree!! i saw a commercial w bryce and i was like "wtf he's actually a good guy?"
trump isnt stupid. incompetent though
kayne doesnt look like a bad option at this point
there's a small loan in there
this debate is really frightening
you'll be getting that and a few other things from me tomorrow :-)
yep. why are you giving him charged runs cmon

condescendus maximus!
you're not wrong.
thanks, pal! i'm back over at my personal account, .
thank you🙏🏼
and with all that $ he couldn't fix it. so sad.
awe, thank you! hope you, mo, and that baby are doing great!
key word maybe!
i don't think he said it in relation to that. as a business person you should pay what you owe according to law.
oh boy now his main problem is how dated are us airports? is he fucking kidding us? who gives an eff about this?
"that makes me smart"
wtf is donald trump talking about?
gonna get me an ovo owl tat so they let me across the border.

yeah, and he just said his tax money would have been squandered too. admission of guilt, no?
yeah? is the wifi wack?
kinda disturbing.
i'm okay with him talking more if it's all defensive blubbering due to her zingers.
well maybe they did a bad job though so
he thinks it should look like the one in dubai.
a lot of them a very small in comparison to trump.

maybe if you actually respected females someone would give you a chance and not judge you based on your actions.
this is the funniest thing you've ever tweeted man
i think we are behind you here he has not mentioned race issue's yet
fact: of lawmaker goes on leave after federal charges surface.
it largely remained silent after clinton concluded. she punted down the middle on race &amp; her position on gun violence was deeply coded.
it's hard to feign intelligence for 90 minutes
we welcome you! remember, we're trying to avoid armageddon.
it was a mistake to bring topic to gun control though
her pantsuit distracts us. too bad she doesn't har red hair
he on that powder.
wheres rain. gave up on watering garden. way too dry.
well, that's what he's saying.
hey watch the debate
i know, right? 😳😳😳
yaaass girl this part is going to be interesting if no one touches it.

mayyyybe. though i would maybe put money on it being called the "trump suite" instead.
well in that case it's true!

tell katiushka to check out ‘s feed

there's been tons all night..."biglsy"
i know. only he is delusional enough to think he does
well and receive a gift in exchange to never forget edgar with some wise words he told a lot of us. all the $ that is collected
just saw it on twitter benches cleared and they brawled.
hate to break it to ya babe, but the seasons over
cablevision is also boasting the red channel and i have my tv set to sports mode for the debate.
just hope we are not going to be made aware of it in the future.
he's making his points. secty hrc has done nothing in 30 years.
creeeepy. 😝😝😝
trump encourages melania to have unlimited "me time."
i think he means he knows chicago. she does not.
so sorry about your loss sir
you almost cut my ear off when i said your birthday was wednesday... i want an apology.
not only does he know more than the generals but he know more than anyone
"trump: the man who fell to earth."
knowing what is and what isn't constitutional is a pretty good start.
listen to "morning" by him, it's my soul song 😭
and that’s why i can’t go for that
i had to take a break because i was getting a tension headache from clenching my jaw.
its more about law and order than race in his discussions.
soooo...i drive while listening? does that count? lol
same. but that's why we stand with her!
no liberal bias there
me or the ?? 😂😂😂
and why is lester letting her talk n talk n talk. i thought they had a limit ??
i don't know and it is driving me fuckin nuts
nope b he looks foolish and woefully unprepared
johnny knockout!
thanks so much
"i think trump should have doubled the xanax." (from nh)
his eyes are getting more pale too. i was surprised how evenly contrast was on his face was for a change at the start.
ian wins best tweet of the night
that is the best idea.
they're very good
lester shut him up. this is so many more than 20 seconds.
that's why the picture of michelle obama and george w went viral this week.
she is on point tonight
she shut him up so quick! mic drop. 🎤
he needs a spray bottle full of water for whenever someone interrupts or goes over time.
if he wants to talk about deleting things he needs to check his staff
it's "bigly"
the readiness is all
might be because some idiot spelled it as 'hilary' on the ticket to the debate 😩
yasssss 👏🏾👏🏾
nothing to do, compared to the fascist dictators of venezuela, this "man" is a child playing to 'the little house'. 😂
trump is the racist as prove by politifact.hillary works with the black community for all of her career.
thanks , i am brilliant
he has literally no answer.
no. i want to remain sober and i'm just so angry so it's not a good mix to add alcohol. so much alcohol as needed
. raise that glass...it's just getting crazier.
and h you were born in , not !
maybe he's really sick. yup, really sick...just sayin
she is smart knowledgable and hard working. he is a charlatan.
he is just an obnoxious, egotistical, holier-than-thou person
so so gross
she is serving it up
and clicking again resulted in my donating twice! yay!
she killed him on everything
look at clinton's arrogant face!!
luckily i had the prying mans lmao
a black cat just walked by twice, so ignore.
why didn't you get george bush jr., sr., clinton, reagan to share their birth certificates?
because trump accused the first black president of not being a citizen and the subject of the debate is racial tension.
jesus!! he's he's...he's..i can't even type
bye loser; volleyball is better than this
. you're right. he's got three-fifths black friends.
that's cool are you excited
the proof is in the pudding.
who knows lol
i'm living for your tweets
all americans are implicitly *biased* - truth. if you don't know this, wake up.
yea its called systemic oppress. we should all be checking our own biases. thats her point.
ugh yeah that’s an unfortunate truth. somehow forcing someone to admit to facts has become political
hillary worked for obama for 5 years. that says more about what was said in a campaign.
she sure did
i honestly think he believes everything he says. he has no idea if he's lying
gun control is the only plan has. it won't work because criminals will always find a way to get guns!
hillary if you are not a racist, trump if you are, the republican party if you don't care about the election outside of this
oh no fish - what u not gonna do is have me alcohol poisoned...cause imma be drinking allllll night :(
this debate is ridiculous isn't no admission of guilt just like pleading the 5th, trump..
you really need to watch humsafar and his other works to know what i am talking about
leave the door open, pee quickly and run like hell
this is in purpose even the hair is cut and dyed less severe his combover looks like a comb forward
excellent point. cannot stoop to his level.
i aint gonna mess with my mom when she changes the channel unless i wanna die
one has some knowledge and ability and one is a know nothing blow hard. ask your boss which is which
this is the best reality show meltdown since theresa's "prostitution whore" table flip on rhnj!!!
yeah! if u were a down cow you would be happy to see nice people come along, down too long, u die!
fuck lmao. shes gonna uncover all of the secret files this nation is hiding away
send help &amp; citizenship plz
that's what i heard 😂
i miss this day and you
but what about a really against judge? what is that?
she rolls in her lips - this is a conversation that she clearly not comfortable.
hit on taxes/birther what about her he emails? he is unfair
'...someone who sits on their bed and weighs 400 pounds...' is he on drugs? nothing he says is related to anything.
ice ice baby!
haha next time i am taking a photo just for you!
your a fucking retard
i hear a ad here.
she really does has a sweet smile, doesn't she
the entire debate - has he been doing it at other events???
it is! margot robbie hosting with the weeknd musical guest!
ah, could be. streamin abc on the apple tv.
but he did build a fabulous country club in west !
yep. i caught that too.
am i mentioned?
union not department
no way you're watching this and saying we'll have the same outcome either way. just no way.
exactly!! they need to their job as a journalist or become the daytime talk show host they are because they fear a fraud.
i was just like no continue donald
maybe that's where his sniffing came from. that might be too cruel.
kdndnnd djndnd omg have you lost your mind 😂😩😩😩😩😩😂😂
the fact check was on murder being up. it is. what hillary surrogate bloomberg did is another question.
we need to make a cortland reunion asap
maybe it was ren?! who says it was russia!
he's a racist and wants applause for allowing blacks and muslims into his club?! he's no friend of israel, btw.
it's a tremendous town
dave wearing rene's jeans?
it's driving me nuts!
trump (cont.): we need to figure out the cyber. all the cyber. cyber, we have to do better. i have a son. he's very good with the computers.
lol you the anti-hotep
your average shit gets 2,000 rts this gonna get 10k minimum
whoa branching out, cl. i see you
i almost want to create a list of every group of people he's criticized in this debate alone. essentially everyone who isn't him.
it is horrifying and embarrassing. it's like a bad movie
your talking about what i said and nothing about what he said your the one not listening
hillary scratches nose for third time
chestnuts roasting by the dumpster fire …
agreed. it's not necessary
you're right, but isn't that the fear? his appeal as an outsider is increased by her cutting him up?
*votes for shmoopy*
i think you know.. mostly i am just ashamed of us all. how the fucking fuck did we get here?
she is the best
like fuck outta here. your local ballot is down the fucking block. there's absentee ballots. and u still chose to do nothing.
lol i thought it was tomorrow i mean tomorrow so we got time to chill before you go 😭😭😭😭
you're the best!! 💖
does the sniff).
thats i.c.e. immigration and customs enforcement. not isis
no they said u had to frisk all people in the area
any link to reasons why? thx!
- there was nothing he cld say without adding 2 his tack of lies!
if any newsmedia in this country is still legit, lead headline tomorrow should just say trump lies
my new favorite tv show produced by - the new
hit on taxes/birther what about her he emails? he is unfair
definitely not.
"a very against police judge." , you and are killing me! please ! !
i hope someone hacks that 10 ur old kid of his that so good with computers. let's see how good he is.
it has more rts than votes
it's a knife set!
is it too late for us to spin this into him being endorsed by the crystal meth lobby?
hang in there...it's almost over...right?
i broke down to and went to wild: rice and bread
how about saying: “3 pinocchios!”
for you. bro
i am right now giving 'lots of thought to nato' i am
his hair is huge...
i have passed annoyed and am now just pissed. can't turn it off, though.
. this we pray.
i’m thinking of upgrading the corona too…
thank you, it's called status of forces agreement and iraq would not sign so we pulled out to protect our troops
and he's proud of it. 🤑
the only thing he drops more than f bombs are cyber bombs.
50% claiming the other side is lying, 50% celebs retweeting
i.. it's almost as if... can only women be sick?!
yeah, these are the most satisfying parts of the debate to be sure.
best entrance in a while.
we are gonna have to take the guns dudes it's only a matter of time. y'all have not ain't evolved enough for the responsibility
lester holt: "wait a minute. wait. is that joe biden's music?!"
probs not. i keep losing count when i get distracted by 's blatant stupidity.
ha for sure. it's amazing any candidates lie nowadays. then again narrative wins. sigh.
and enjoy your white supremacist endorsed overlord.
lester holt totally ineffectual at calling out trump on iraq
were you in your suite banging? lmao
meant to reply to u but also we can't forget he said that
you can do better.
nothing to be thrilled about!!! a lying, narcissistic woman should not be leading our country!!!
it actually wasn't supposed to happen lol
i don't know why he hates his/our city and the facts
way better self control than i.
i'm just sick of how wwe is ran
works at fox. tv and radio host.
i'll be home from the 29th until the 3rd i think!!
...said allotted time? like, for example, directtv where you can do that. thanks.
that 'k' is drunk on debates.
he sounds a bit like a confused teenager
(well and i had just gotten done talking to my brother for 45min)
you want vs
certainly what it sounded like.
*don't react, we practiced this hillz, don't react*
should have taken her apart over isis
trumps 10 y/o son is on it
so did me and and
earlier he said "avoiding taxes, etc." makes him smart. just calling hypocrite.
understood. i wish you peace.
it's pretty sad man 2 more nights like this 🙄
he also just dissed your integrity and reporting. how dare he?
crowd laughter was cherry on top of this implosion
ive got big meat hook hands so stickering blocks/tokens/meeples etc is a pain in the butt
amen, sir. it is actually a tragedy.
racist, former cheese steak enthusiast sean hannity
after this i need a good spanking &amp; 7 hours in a hyperbolic chamber. and i don't even know why!!
ugh he is so stupid like fuck answer the question
dt was right. no one wants to call sean hannity lol
needs another hit of whatever's giving him the sniffles
i will not vote top of ticket. only local stuff. these two are a disgrace.
&amp; my neighborhood is too sketch for me to go out alone at night... need donald trump to and bring back to nyc
ugh i know. i sometimes think americans are not so bright. clearly, otherwise trump wouldn't even have been there. at all
why thank you, my friend! so nice to see your name and face.
doode i saw u walking out and im in that class right now and it keeps flying at us
but how many times have we been wrong???
and he lost an election stop with this sexist bs wishing for another penis in the race.
lets me clear: all your figures are pulled directly out of your asshole
it's a damn shame when you get blocked for freedom of speech
this is what i like to see.
yes but we lose on everything...
i'll be gone after one topic
...not just those at the top, like hillary.
it's in a white neighborhood he is so disillusioned
also can we all pls stop saying hillary is even remotely as much of an "evil" as trump
it feels a lot more like this to us...
i'm with you on this. especially since someone won't supply me with bake and shark 🙄
come to ice house for the last set.
that's either a trump debate quote or my response when asked 'who ate all the buckeyes?'
trump is kind of being rewarded for having misplaced and stereotypical female attributes like being erratic emotional and wacky
i love mattresses. i own properties in mattress.
trump respects trump. that's it.
i thought 's post was timely &amp; was curious if is still acting obtuse about commonly accepted terms. i found out. 😣
explains why his website went down
but he's not a birther anymore, big league!
problem is trump is a fucking retard that is acting like a 9 year old. a disgrace to this beautiful country of ours!
ugh chanel put me out of my misery when is this over
he's said "the secretary" a lot too.
trump will never be the president of the greatest country in the world. this man said we live in a third world country... lol
hillary supports sharia law, i don't!
what policies?? lol
he's not going anywhere.
stay cool, friend.
same to you. we should play some golf sometime.
"what do you plan for [relevant issue]" "idk but have u seen the size of my ball-- i mean money"
i wouldn't drink a beer with him if he was buying the beer if the gods.
2 busy collecting💰💰from💂🏼👳🏽 countries that torture women,gays,christiansur amoral&amp;mental🇺🇸✝ …
she doesn't have much time. if hillary spent her time defending his insanity, she'd get no points in.
or is this just some clever ad for game of thrones , if so brilliant
every time he interrupts her, every time she politely waits for him to finish his turn, it feels all too familiar.
privitize weld
no, but he likes to pretend he's a patriot. that demands respect for the office--but you're right. too much to ask.
"nuclear war is bad, mmmkay?" - mr. mackey, who already had better hair and less annoying vocal tics than trump
which channel? we haven't seen that.
frowning all way to the bank lmao . his school getting paid
and the hair. that hair.
former kyle barraclough!
. lol you paid money for your trash to show up on my feed
oh dear god his answer to that is even worse. no real amazing witty soundbites, eh
can even imagine? the twitter meltdown following? omg.
unreal. so many bad decisions.
allowed too many inexcusable points like.the long fg and roughing punter. this should.be over
not yet. but there has been enough litigation to indicate that it will be and should be.
i was happy i got triumph and tragedy already stickered lol
thank you :3
lol sean we "put the lid on irans nuclear capability!"
i would like it to be perceived as more of a playful jab at his presidential candidate choice-- from a fan👍🏻
that's not a secret, he literally said it during the commander in chief forum, but no one picked up on it. so sad. 😢
just an fyi telling me not to criticize a public official is antithetical to my beliefs and principles. never do that to me.
us young folk are realizing the harm and are not practicing regardless of which religion you were brought up on
we are in the mohawk valley!
thanks babe yours is too ❤️❤️🌹
exactly my motivation sometimes
yes because he's filling space with all those words.
hrc have "stamina or look" a prime example of why lester is trying to get trump to just answer the question instead he rants
excellent work. little mac!
lmao i just said the same thing. trying to parent on stage
her husband happy so he went and cheated on the dumb wrinkly bitch makes it even better
stop the hillarity!
i said no such thing!!!
ive gone from "i can't believe im voting for clinton" to "i'm considering donation to clinton's campaign" over the course of this
is it greedy to ask that the mariners lose too??
lol i have to wear mine
idgaf abt his tax returns... i wanna see his twitter analytics.
she handled that loser b
also wants credit for letting blacks drink out of the "normal" fountains at his country club
well one of the parties is at least addressing racism in this country and it isn't your baby hitler.
i miss college
i really wish people were not wasting their time watching this dumb debate featuring 2 idiots.
thank you i appreciate it a lot
if he’s still interested in politics after this, you have a problem
i'm just impressed he knew what that word meant
throw tomatoes.
tfw you realize this went on for 90 minutes
not a lot of stamina on your period
i low key love your drinking brown likka from a mason jar.
hit on taxes/birther what about her he emails? he was unfair
yup it's hard to moderate a racist bully running for president 🤔
hmm, putting ur opponent down in a presidential debate by mannerism is never a good idea. worse than harsh verbals
i've never read something i've agreed with more.
because didn't give you a chance to.
oh and that bit where he screamed i have a better temperament!!!!
not i if i feel like the conversation is going no where i'll hang up
it was excellent
the soylent
. i guess he needed to save it for his taxes? oh, wait...
she trounced him i think
thank goodness
trump failed hard
i'm happy for this debate, he has no self control, just full of himself
i apoligize.
im suspicious of sample bias
. tom brokaw and mark shields may be merging into one person.
true yeah, but some of them gas station be tryna charge
there were multiple what are you waiting for strikes tonight
what a casa-fucking-nova
hundreds of millions and all of them very not nice, bc women gotta be nice
meet you in district 13
“oh right, i’m supposed to do that before the camera cuts.”
probably because he doesn't know the facts
yup. he's about to go in on twitter
you are correct about that
what event is happening in your photo sukhjit?
listen/support your local public radio &amp; tv to learn what you can do to take bake our country &amp; save us all!
hit the wrong button waaaah
a $5 off coupon..but i'm pissed now bc hooters is closed too and i just wanted some damn hot wings
she sometimes stammered though. still better than trump whose sniffing looked like he caught some of that pneumonia himself
i was laughing so hard like wtf just happened,,,
holt's contribution to hilry - woudnt move off birther so she could avoid economy
they are not troubled by it they have their criminal justice system to deal with that plus where is the correlative things that created it?
agreed... sick of her .
how bout you focus on the presidential debate!
nobody cares what you have to say honey, it over, show some love for your next president
best set i heard on that roof this summer.
from an evidentiary perspective, she fucking crushed it.
thanks event!
well you're lucky she represents you, then.
in conclusion, the rosie o'donnell show should've not been cancelled in 2002.
if you find a captured version of that, pls share!
also, trump exposed all the problems hillary has created and failed to resolve over the years.
do do it! just wear an ankle brace thang n you good 😂
i want this on my tombstone
he'd make the dude proud.
lock her up, if nothing else, for spite.
he didn't lose. he knows nothing and said nothing and is a complete blow-hard. but she smirked a lot and is arrogant.
in fairness if you state 10 biggest issues to smear russia, an objective person would find 10 worse things about the us 😳
great smokes👍
remember this game? never bet on echo fox
how can you vote for someone who never replies and always avoid questions. she made a mistake and tonight again she admitted it.
spiders are terrifying, this is mildly annoying
i am planning a small dash competition through asp program and from there we might think of hosting a dash competition
i'm guessing 1996 but i was a late bloomer
clint eastwood.
will hilary release 30000 emails for trump tax release ?
i literally called that she would wear a red suit i'm so happy she did.
want to run a 5k??
thank you!!!
you smaht. i can't look away. torn between "we deserve this" and ineffable sadness.
yes lmao second time it's happened to me in 5 days
i think she communicated better
the epitome of fatasses
i'd still buy from you ❤️
maybe he's coming down with something. like the bubonic plague?
same. the whole time i'm muttering under my breath a super long w w w h h a t t ~
the champ won. but barely. ;)
and our elections last so long that by this point, the merge feels normal. he was buffoonish, but not enough to disqualify himself.
everytime he had hilary caged up, she would smile to show her cool and it happened very often tinight.
it works for you
i think it's time.
agree 100%!
and i have been to falls.
where's the leather jacket?
i think filled in the blanks when he chose to demonize immigrants as criminals
fortunately you're not his advisor
that shit is beautiful
. so. freaking. awesome! ❤️
kdk8 and kurt learn to dance
i was so annoyed with not asking one tough question of her.
i agree he could've pushed on the emails issue, but then she ended it by admitting the full fault
haha it's all good! it certainly was awesome acoustic! set: lucky denver mint,big casino,sure &amp; certain, new song&amp;the middle
this wasn't a debate! this was hrc chance 2 attack trump! as colton powell said hrc messes up everything!
not sad. he's slipping on his own shit.
apparently she smiled too much????!!?????
some fucking me shit
agree, i think lester holt held his own as well as anyone could.
oddly enough, someone i work with mentioned this to me today so it's a sign i now must go.
yeah seems to me they saw a very disconnected candidate that sometimes sounded real alongside a stilted, but true politician.
wanted more on her damaging policies!
but at this point i don’t really see how i can vote any differently than i plan to.
thanks homie! 💕 miss you
who knows, really, but i'm kind of (very) upset they aren't playing still breathing. that's my favorite of the three released
yeah like an hour later of me sitting at the bottom of that girls apartment complex in the heat
wrong* fuck i failed
no lol so thats why i am super confused
it's so frustrating!! im really hoping apple increases the storage when they come out with the new macbook pros!
he'd release it before only for those emails
he does have all his tax money to spend on other things....
and no protest votes for national office. that’s an abdication of your civic duty.
where did hillary get that pants suit chairman mao?
she was pumped with ?
i stay off of fb.i don't want to discuss politics with friends. ltrump is mean, cheating elitist.i lived in dads trump village
shameful. he just doesn't get it. who was he to ask our president for his papers. come on
it would have been amazing. it would have been the best encore song after jos. like when they did brutal love after jos in 2013
i was there in spirit. hope to come home soon!
eithervthatvor he's on coke!
where did hillary get that pants suit chairman mao?
here mfer 0️⃣➖3️⃣ you cost me money
ahh i keep losing this! i'm saving this and favoriting it forever.
what? you can be over-prepared? what does that mean? see and ? unbelievable.
and will the media fall for it? probably. not you/all in, but the daytime coverage? yep.
lol no, that guy is off the rails, i wouldn't waste my money
either that or he's on coke!
still coolin tho
that hurts, but it's true.
i think you can find that on the interwebz? 😂
i couldn't even get in, they gave tickets to only 100 kids out of the whole school 😂
because he can't tell the difference.
i agree! likely had to do coke to stay awake and smoked enough weed to make him doze off.
wait did i miss something? romney did well with women? trump will exceed romney margin w women easily.
i did earlier today in preparation for this evening
i love how brags about following the "if you don't have anything nice to say..." rule. that one time.
need something to make it seem like she didn't do well. wouldn't have said if was a man debating.
net neutrality
the reason i know i couldn't be president. i could not have kept my chill up there.
whaaaaat?! didn't think i would hear that from you. to each their own 😘
a very minuscule (yet true) part of his epic fail.
right behind ya!
i heard that. nice new word. it will probably be added to the dictionary.
: he does, but you, lying treasonous hilarity, don't.
we want to hear your opinion! join us on talkshow for a little bit ...debate.
people called in and voted for trump again and again and again!!! they're so excited
i got my vikings scarf ready for the sb run.
gotta gain a few hundred pounds
this is why dems are struggling. a perception gap.
what planet where you watching from?
the only good thing about election night is going to be ‘s tweets
talk of a traitor. no one say that about our country. the world is watching dummy.
if hillary wins i stay here...if trump wins we move. pretty big life change
well, only if there's no !
she had to be prepared with all the bullshit being slung around left and right.
3rd party candidate?
i think he met his expectations
lol now i got someone to move in with 😏
where did hillary get that pants suit chairman mao?
thanks kyle i needed that 👊🏽 reassurance
and we need to hold on to he notion that we have the best democracy in the world.
just required major version bump and some build tool reorg. and lots of other stuff on my plate :p
they'll go up for sure. he swayed enough of the electorate who want someone else in there to last this long.
gotta do something on the 3rd debate.
and you said nothing as well...
she's a liar though, can you blame him otherwise? you guys are discrediting someone who is in support of you... just saying.
if you are talking about the ny airports he is 100% correct.
the internet will decide that not his spin doctors.
this is interesting bro
what did y'all think?
because hildabeast is worse? duh
so do i… it would explain the fact he hasnt done anything with his returns as of yet..
she was unquestionably focused. the result of experience and preparation.
luntz' data isn't showing that tonight....thoughts?
my synopsis of the debate
the one that replaced skip? he just like regular i don't like him but i don't dislike him.
thanks joe, always ❤️ a !!
will see how polls pan out; just like many of your trades you will be proven wrong; shorting bonds still?
media whore
hillary definitely had clear, concise points, whereas i just don't think donald trump had the stamina.
what about bridge gate
wowww, gotta blast. it's not safe here. i wonder who it is.
'bigger' is an adjective being used to describe the noun 'issues', so top of the class!
totally agree. that's why i think if it were asked from an honest place instead of as a laugh line it would be a good question
he is so not nailing it. he can't even answer the question directly.
considers modern maritime law a european biased construct and therefore revisionist in itself.
flagged badly 5min in! shouting and sniffing like a crackhead
yessssssssss
: and to consider it a point of pride. complains about infrastructure. refuses to pay for it. sad. elitist too.
could only mean one thing....
i just really needed some jessica fletcher after all that, you must understand!!
oh, 91? i thought it was 41. i'd go more with 50-60 won't vote for her from what i've read and personal experience.
i am the president of her super pac. join me.
there's a difference between trump's bold-faced whoppers &amp;, sadly, the lies we've grown accustomed to from all politicians.
there are two countries at this point and neither can understand the other
i agree. us idiot media totally disagrees
-why was trump snorting so much during the debate?
i don't know if i'm voting
we are all in the ninth circle of hell!
you right ma
you didn't miss much face turn happens next week
no upgrade, but an enjoyable flight all the same! thanks.
why do you think she did?
you already hate on me hella hard
but the point is that she is wrong. trump has been saying so for months. give him credit for leading onit
i was subtweeting myself lmao
good to see non falcon fans recognize this.
you're wearing the same outfit for the today
i finally found some!
thanks baby, his loss if anything
oh katy, stop being so supportive of trump
he doesn't know how to take a deep breath through his mouth!
it's a bug, possibly try nesting the whole sequence and then send to media encoder. otherwise add in mencoder
twice, whit. twice. on different shoots days apart. "oh, this goes with dior and mcqueen" "haz, i don't think-" "i said it goe
im an african american &amp; i don't live in hell but if trump were to win we all will be living in a place hotter
so is that a no on the record.
he didn't have to!
you know i stay following
just got a pair of the green ones last week! soooo comfy. gonna need another pair stat
i’m wary of that - a huge part of interactive fiction games is your agency while playing. you make the choices.
what fat shaming?? nobody even regards the source, right??
the one thing i wanted to hear was what would they do about stopping terrorists here in u.s neither really answered the q! 🤔
i fucking wish
trump is an idiot. hillary whipped his ass. he looked like he need a nap by sniffling and drinking water.
aha! yeah, we're south facing!
this is my last week here so come up this weekend
either that or it will be 1 of the more intelligent callers to cleveland sports talk radio to talk about his job at lowe's
hoping to be cleared for work by oct 15th. :)
the same way far rockaway is technically nyc. you can move out to a burb in the east bay…

shaw says he's feeling good enough that he wanted to play friday, but coaches obviously aren't going to let him
i really don't think this is unreasonable and clearly i'm with her. this is a clear policy ask from a leader.
me- no i didn't call you cum guzzling slut friend- *pulls up texts, tweets, blog posts* me-
sorry. will delete my ruh roh
flawless, no blemishes, no pores...i don't even think she knows what a blackhead is
bernie spoke about real issues. now we gotta choose who is the lesser of two evils.... this whole election is a joke!
apparently he went to the spin room while i was having a celebratory yogurt

you really think so? i think hillary won, and i'm not a hillary supporter!
the people know you will make this country great again n that you will change the corrupt system. we don't want a politican
gotta take that sause
so much for 's cornering of
the cyber won
laughable... not w/o holt's assistance...
by nose breathing he was accessing his nasopharynx resonators to effectively sweeten his speaking tone as to avoid sounding gruff
you can't vote for both... that's not possible
she has been talking about this non-stop for weeks. great band teacher. they learn music and beats before instruments.
laguardia is, as always, under construction. the taxi stand is further away from the terminal because of this 👉🏿
ahhhhhhh 😩😩😩
you mean jay-z and beyonce?
oh please so lame he never voted for any war your gal is the warmonger
i won't be sharing any details that aren't public knowledge, if i ever think of any. buffering 40 seconds internally for a 1080p stream is…
oh and bad lip reading
i convinced myself she cared lol 😂 marty's like bitch please... um no..
especially not the american people.
ok, will have to give it a go. after the heat wave, since vive is in the garage.
policy issues? she has policy, he has issues.
always won my fantasy games so 🙌
that's because your dad lost. lol!
i guess you have a point.
don't worry about it. probably just a black racist homophobic democratic piece of bat guano.
i can't find a gif from tonight, but i saw this response on hillary's face, giving him enough rope...
slide her my way
to be fare, it is the clinton news network. (sarcasm).
should have been more descriptive on issue. re:protestors "punch them in the face"
literally i know😂😂😂
i believe the joke you're responding to was about drudge's poll. nothing scientific about either.
and if trump wins?
whoops, or even ! either way, don't sleep
danke (just practicing in case trump wins. maybe it should be russian.)
the cyber is e-vapor-ating into the real world
... american political pundit class from ever being taken seriously again.
day 7 and im lk still goin (-;
and forgetting their "readers"
i don't think you should be sorry. it's crucial to discuss these things.
i'm so glad that didn't get lost on other people. "last little while" for an entire race! wow
that was a good statement
same tbh especially when she was breaking necks while walking through the halls
because high profile suspects get brought in alive, because das want their convictions. the shit's political not racial.
hey, "cyber" is tough, man.
they must be so dumb why do we listen to them
cuban, you are a bored idiot! stay out of politics!
lmao i had to pick up tashay crazy ass . i'll see if she ew ta to come back😂
they both did jill stein justice by swaying more undecided over to independent tickets ! selfish debate &amp; individuals...sad
because cheney rumsfeld rice &amp; bush are walking around free &amp; easy.
like tv interview where she said she was flat-broke leaving wh &amp; now thru extortion foundation is worth 200m
would it kill you to admit she won the debate? and handily.
when you've struck out vs when you've hit a homer
love you shay shay remember if you need me i can just hop the fence and be over in 3 minutes
i find the prospect of a trump presidency frightening for our constitution and for our planet.
that's real great bro. we need to definitely catch up when i'm back in town... i'll be there either the 13th or 14th.
that she voted for. he would have thrown that in her face.
thought you'd be proud.😑💣
pun not intended
among most trivial grotesques he said but surprisingly affecting for me, what a creep and proud of it
oh man, the energy at the office viewing party was awesome tonight. 🎉
perhaps but only b/c of
guess she'll have to school you on those topics in debates 2 and 3, if you show up.
hillary has all the economic sense of a implant. she creates government jobs. :/
the corporate ties on hillary are pretty imposing. question: who will she really work for?
you're a real person djt!!! hrc is status quo! debate nowadays are for tv ratings only. we want a prez with conviction!
i get it, but stronger argument in 4yrs with scotus off the table. that's the more strategic move
cnn could have worn ear plugs and they would give the to
but then he butchers irene adler.
you should have brought gennifer flower for hillary to remember what bill did to women!
he should never have brought you up. baad move. you are not exactly unbiased.
he doesn't have a formal title.
if we don't get the money 2 take care of equipment or protect our military personal, i wouldn't let my son die 4 them
me too, and i'm not even a woman, except in spirit.
holy crap. hope you're okay!
which debate did you watch?
i care more about ending street violence than about where obama was born. at this point, it doesn't matter.
why is college so expensive the only glow i get is from sweating over these midterms 😒
dammit, i wish i’d presumed that too
he was horrible.
candidates should have to pass a competency test before they can run!
attacking jill stein doesn't make me wrong. bernie was the better choice from the beginning.
sjw? seriously? fact: white women benefit the most from aa. fact: qualified poc still face bias during job searches.
we won't have to worry about the climate it we are all executed by isis! security of our country priority
what about reverse discrimination when certain religious entities muslim entitlement to discriminate against non-muslims.
coastside cert is trained in lg animal evac
i was on about clara but works for both. 😁
majority watching cnn are for clinton, so poll a joke! fox poll shows trump won debate!
yeah and they'll say i don't have problems
trump patting himself on the back at the end for not saying something awful about the clintons. ridiculous!
it might be on afterward. im gonna try to record it too.
so says the ass who accused me of using drugs with zero proof. crawl back under your rock.
the tip off is in autocorrect - it doesn't recognize it yet! and yes.
glad to buck you up tonight.
i would imagine that prosecutors and judges would have to be complicit if these were &lt; than terry
these are insane omg!!!! so talented!!
yeah but they'll say she started it
are we talking about trump or sam here?
- as for toppings, i like pepperoni and bacon, but i usually opt for plain. white pizza is also nice if it's salty.
some atheists are foolish and superstitious that doesn't change fact they you are also.

that he is now as dependent on a horse race for his job as the rest of the msm...
you will be shocked when you watch it..
after some called a lion...... tiger is shying away alas they compare him
yes you can, but you could also go through a laundry list of change &amp; progress we have made. we still have a long way to go.
sorry didn't know!
this…this is real?
even your justification for a racist comment is racist
hillary the best ..
you just don’t know how to lose.
really mike let's be honest 25 mins good 60 mins defending himself...defend the country..bad

let me guess at how outraged he was concerning the 13 attacks on embassies with 60 dead during bush admin.
dude, your guy got destroyed by a girl!! i admit there are two more debates, but when he has bobby knight helping him

i used turkey bacon because my local target had a bacon sale which meant 90% of the bacon was gone by the time i arrived.

but that's kinda his approach to life. so par for the course certainly. 💩
so like does bernie still have a chance?
we posted it today.
the right honorable gentleman has lost himself in his verbiage. wake up and smell the coffee bitch.
welcome to a pretty cool screen.

i'd have to say the chicken was trump &amp; ur guy hillz

yup and????? 😤
the right honorable gentleman has lost himself in his verbiage.
she can with a different approach in the next debate.more aggressive, no awkward smiling, relatable vocabulary
he gets less and less air time in live events!
i can't imagine he'll do something as unprecedentedly weak as pulling out of a debate.
next time, please give this mad man a good mike

well damn right! hope we see there. okay andy, we'll leave you be now.
i don't think anyone won,but i'm not a fair judge i conked out halfway through,probably why i'm single!
that's right, trump doesn't pay any taxes, we do, and the sob is rubbing it in our faces.

djt will never be the policy wonk like hrc, that's not his appeal,so he has to be old trump for most of the debates.
it's certainly possible. i hope not. i don't have any evidence. i'm just speculating that he's getting sued in some way.

holt was a disgrace. birther? why will no national tv reporter press hillary on any of her scandals.she got softball questions
they played dirty and labeled bernie as racist and sexist. that's david brock.
web and mobile app expertise here - get quote -
that's really the only thing missing nowadays: a good soundtrack. in 2k16 i changed it to the wrestlers' entrance music.
'cause conversely, said that being president doesn't change who you are.
so hilariously dishonest. you would have said that no matter how she performed. polls clearly show trump won.
hillary is so corrupt and shes a typical politician. sounds great but will change nothing
what did you look at?
i was so delighted by the bob dylan reference early on in that. lots of fun.
it's clear that has changed the participatory nature of elections in the usa. brilliant.
different standards for black americans, or for those of us who identify as black, which the president does.
holt was wrong to press him on bs. holt never pressed her on anything. biased again
if they're off stage they aren't candidates.
i won't say anymore to ruin it for u-just hope u don't find it as painful to watch as i did. u may have another opinion of it.
why not put a moderator in that will press hillary on any of her scandals or failures? the fix is in
sadly true. nevertheless hc is only qualified stable leader.

agree but why don't u take her to task for calling birther movement racist? no evidence &amp; obama took 2 1/2 years to produce his bc.
kind of you to say so! and i see why you did there... ~mastergregg
definitely was a good one
without reality's help...
i'm allowed 🙆🏾😊 (my fancy lulu ones that don't look like sweats)
add with miss the love!
we want all the jamie wednesday recordings on cd!
maybe she should have tried the stuff that caused trump to keep sniffing all night. or she was just bored.
the ignorant ones won't care and that's the scary part. i need to move out of this country.
outreach could have been bettr however civil rights icons like john lewis blatantly lying about bernie's record is unacceptabl
she is happy in our machine shed in our hospital pen eating hay 😀
wtf is the point ofpresidentialdebates if not to look experienced and calmand presidential infront of nation?
that sovereignty of god argument is very strange.

for real! not like i text anyone lol
on our site 😊🙏🏽
to be fair they still admitted she won. but yeah, sorta saw the tap dance coming
actually no earl, they don't every single snap poll of live watchers found hillary won by a huge margin

9:43p it’s clear trump has no idea what a debate is &amp; has never actually debated an equal. he rants &amp; shouts over &amp; interrupts.

trump's not (trade) nor is he (tax, guns, lgbt, scotus, etc)

bet u don't even know a single intelligent thing about the debate...
lester holt turned in an excellent performance as moderator. controlled, fair &amp; dignified.
just now he came in and took a post-it. and then ripped it up. i...i'm not gonna make it through today.
no. we will not stop. the emails contain evidence of the crimes in haiti. haiti wants to see them and so do we.
donald trump was working for the america people since then and prior. proud of his patriotism.
good luck. parenting is not easy, but it is also a blessing when the kid comes and gives your the biggest hug!

if he creeps on my twitter tell him i want to meet bobby baclava
will america sink so low as to elect a classless creep like trump to lead the greatest nation on earth?
ooo thanks for sharing that
all that accomplished was just giving us stein supporters more reason not to vote hillary

thanks kent! it feels amazing to be rocking out on something again :)
so proud to be your supporter
is not alone.
oh god me toooo. minus the vicodin, alas.
my head is swimming just thinking bout mr trump. he really believe he is so smart. everything was i not us or we. blacks wake up.
rather than treating it as "i will if you will," it should just be interpreted as "i won't b/c i think you did a bad thing"
it's not going to happen! he blew any chance he had right up his nose last night!
i wasn't insulting him. pointing out his exemplary qualities of temperment is not insulting. btw, she spoke policy.
amen bishop. blacks need to listen to what is said .we need to be kept in our place. look at how he spoke of the potus.
honestly was confused omg
a bigoted white nationalist has galvanized the republican party...let's let that sink in for bit.
i also showed up to class 30 minutes early because my anxiety kicked in and freaked me out
thanks artur, our chats along the way were helpful!
having particular fun with inputting formulas and text with arrow keys.

she was micro-targeting chris and !
i know, right? this one gets old! i used it, when debated .
ditto! lets pack up &amp; leave!
hey linea nm how r you girl
no fair displaying trump. that is negative.
everyone plays different roles in the industry but we all work together to create and inspire...why r we fighting each other
with l. bell back should i drop or hold on too d williams ?
not that simple. gu makes little space available for homecoming parties, intentionally pushing them into nhood.
rudy giuliani = dead politician. what makes him think that what he has to say matters to anyone but the donald?
this is what i like to see on my tl.
💔 devastating. much love and prayers to his family and fellow fire fighters
especially not in a high stakes election. get off your high horse and protect your fellow citizens from a bigoted tyrant.
&amp; don't let any raven get in your way 🚅
support democrats, people!
yes i tried at midnight but their system was down… it was like 9am pdt. iphone 7 plus black 128gb.
ted cruz is the biggest ass kisser i have ever seen. unbelievable
it'd be comedy except i'm not laughing: why? "oh, snap!"
ask them is there a reason why they need constant follow-up and that you know what resources to leverage if you need help.
also equip more doctors to provide mental health support
they must've kicked me off the cool black babes email list ;(
you've cracked nothing. i'm leaning back in my office chair getting paid. you're wasting your own free time on me. lol
real.. humbling experience rt in other news my son's mom beat me in fantasy football this week.....................whatever.
i'm full of stories like this but saving some of the better ones for my memoir.
haha i agree, but i was thinking more in the immediate. like buying a burrito from the chain instead of the local spot because $
can't u see he wears a coat that is larger in the front and a long wide tie to cover his belly
trump didn't respond the the questions he was asked, he just talked over the moderator and used talking points
thank you for rt. tell us more about yourself. also send us pics, video. we love to share good advice/tips
same reason when u come to glendale and don't text me, it's a mystery lol jk
rick dees also lives there so asking him first. got off on the wrong foot though, as he doesn't like to talk about disco duck.
the right amount is just enough to devour our critics whole, without getting bones stuck in our teeth. *grins*
she was totally prepared for anything he could have thrown at her. donald was just unprepared
same. god i remember loving this episode so much. it's so good watching it now.
yes america wants her to answer but she smiles with a stupid bad teeth smile instead
is it coming to the feed?
steph &amp; david you guys &amp; me get to"keep" the "stuff" we have from the 3rd estate?while hrc straight-jackets relief?

think that should be discussed at length. i don't see how with as one of the debaters, too deep.
half pint is correct
i just see her and her husband as terrible people.
the other irony of course is i was thanked for using the app upon exiting.
google cloud has been pretty serious about it recently. i guess time will tell
i'm sorry i didn't see it was from donald.
he could probably play in the middle of the back too😳
you make me sooooooooo hungry!!!!
of course it is. cult leaders have a way of convincing their flocks to say or do (or hashtag) anything.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 word tho !! ... tell her we doing this instead of you going there 😭😭☝🏽️
then when i was on the phone with my mom she's like "that doesn't do anything lol" so i pissed on myself in public for no reason
yes agreed but he tried to change when he took over - botha's regime was a non democratic military regime

my favorite part is i clicked a paid google ad to go to a website that didn't have the answer. (no beef)
so if y see deklerk gvt as rational &amp; wanting a sit in the gvt then planned division strategy did/would not work

okay so i'm enjoying this quite a bit. great cast and characters all pretty likeable or at least engaging in some way.

thanks felicia!
sounds like a party
but go ahead, deny the deaths hillary helped cause or keeps saying they dont matter...:)
it's ok if you can't support hillary. i can never support trump. i support the united states of america.
ok. when you discover the perfect person let us know. meanwhile, hrc clearly outstrips trump in this regard.
do they have patios in alberta? does somebody have to shovel the snow off constantly?
they literally got every aspect of my music taste (female pop trash, musical theatre, 7th grade punk, hipster trash, study music)

who will stand with her-when it's all over because from the looks and sound of her. that woman has been living in pain ever since.

no no, the money quote is "it’s tough to see any harm"
which means a vote for stein hurts &amp; helps both candidates. and unlike you, we don't vote for horrid warmongers.
i think that was utah.
and nobody's keeping you from voting dem, stop being a pushy "berniebro' and telling us how to vote.
christ don't remind me the shit i've seen
