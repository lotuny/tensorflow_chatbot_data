Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Why?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
Wow
She okay?
Great
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
No, but
How many people were in your old school?
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
You know French?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
You got him involved?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Will Bogey get bent?
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Hey -- do you mind?
Where ya goin?
Yeah
Two legs, nice rack...
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
It's about time.
Hey.
Nope - just came by to chat
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
What's this?
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
You think this'll work?
What'd he say?
You didn't
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
Like you could find one
Start a band?
Who?
So what did I have an effect on ?
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Put your right foot there --
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
You tell me.
My grandmother's .
Was that your sister?
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
You think?
Macbeth, right?
What plan?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Have a great time, honey!
He's the devil's child...
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
Don't you realize your words could be considered heretical?
What is it, now?  Tell me...
I understand that you will soon be appointing Governors for the islands?  Is it not so?
Do you swear on all the Holy Saints in heaven?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
What do you see?
... and also to bring medicine.
How did you manage it?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
Two minutes... and already you're a dead man.  Don't let passion overwhelm you, Colon.
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
Colon!
All of them!  Just lies!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
What are you saying?
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
I believed in you...
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You bloody...
You tell that to them!
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
What about back home?
I'll make some for us.
A cop?
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Who did cause and origin?
I let her take a shower.
Chief - mind if I take her?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
Where is she?
Sorry...PD only.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
What's wrong?
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
You know what that is, right?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
I kill someone famous.
Is it drug related?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright.
Alright.
Hey, honey.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Yeah.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
He's from Antigua.  His girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  Stabbed her with a beer bottle.
And what do you do with the bones?
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Listen to me.  I don't want sex.  Just give me the address and then you go.
How much money are you carrying with you?
Who is he?
In here, says he wants a million.
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Turn that off!  Get the bags.
Gotta light the scene better.  Now it's more moody... like a scene from THE THIRD MAN.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
What is it?
I did.
No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders?  So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous!
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
You got that?
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
We started over, you can too.
Robert...?
You've got a call.
Yeah?
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
A cheap hotel.
No.  Go ahead.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Yeah?  What kind?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
You go home.  I'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
Get outta here!
This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.
Really.
I don't know. All I heard is that there's something about the mission we weren't told.
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Good morning. How's it going?
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Hal?
I guess not.
Sorry to interrupt the festivities, Dave, but I think we've got a problem.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Well, don't worry about it.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?
CONTINUED
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Thank you.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Roger.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
I'm candy...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
You're gonna help us take him.
Where's ganz?
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.
You here to write my life story?
Yeah, I noticed...
You're crazy.
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
I don't give out the details.
Hey, you wanna bet?
I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
You made that move, huh?
I been waiting a long time for some money.
He's after your money.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Where's the goddamn car?
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
You know, I'd be embarrassed if I let my wheels go the way you've done with this job.
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
What about Luther?
We missed.
Tell me something.  Why didn't you just take the money off Luther and split?
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Notice something funny about that bus?
Hey, how'd my car get here?
You okay?
Okay, reggie, start bustin' my chops... Tell me how great you were with that chick.
Thanks.
I want to be left alone on this one. Algren was killed with my gun.
Yeah?
What a screw-up.
I think I wanna have a discussion about it with any of the ones still walking.  Can we find them?
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Doesn't look like it.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Hey, I don't believe it.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Hard man to live with.
He was the only one of my bunch that was my friend... He was loyal, went all the way for you...
Stall.
Surprise, Luther.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
When?
You sure?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
They all like this in your family, father?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Of course.
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Do you love her?
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
At least, the cat comes back.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
Hi Ma...
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
Yeah?
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Is that all?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
It's my wife.
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Finished what?
Where you going?
You're nothing but a... a...
I'm so very sad.
Not going to open?
It's not?
Have you identified it?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
I want your best man on this!
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Am I disturbing you?
Tom...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Who are you calling?
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
A fellow investor.
You said something about money.
That's five thousand dollars.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
What's the problem?
Friend of yours?
... sorry...
What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Few days ago, I was contacted by a couple living in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.  What happened was they picked up a young girl hitchhiking off 81, which heads into Philadelphia, started up a conversation with this girl, she looked homeless, seemed about eighteen maybe.  They convinced her to let them buy her a meal in the city.  Nice kid, mature, didn't have much to say, but they got a sense she's a runaway, so all through dinner the doctor's working on her, trying to convince her that at the very least she should pick up a telephone.  Not surprisingly, she ate her food, excused herself...  That's the last they saw her.  The reason they came to me for help, the reason I'm coming to you, is we had a friend of mine in the department work up a sketch...  They want to see if I can I.D. this girl, somehow pass along a message to let the parents know the kid's alive, doing alright.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Who is this.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
How much did he pay you?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
A man like Mr. Christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...
You almost went over your limit.
He's lying.
Well, whatever there is, whoever's dealing, however it's done, I want to know.  I want a good look, so if you've got that kind of connection, great.  If not, speak now.
I'm not a cop.
How much do you make now?
... Hello... ?
I heard you asking.  That guy wasn't yanking you around.  There's no such thing.
How old are you?
Who is he?
What's next?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Pittsburgh?
He succeeded.
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.  I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business.  Not till now, that is.
You don't have any other choice.
Do you think the film could have cost that much?
Okay.
I've been hired as an independent contractor by the U.S. Resource Center for Missing Persons as part of an internal audit.  If you have any time over the next few days, I'd like to make an appointment to ask some questions about the disappearance of your daughter.
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
Are you religious?
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
What is this?
Alice, you think you can leave?
You alright?
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
Kristen, what happened?
You in a hurry?
You've been up all night?
I thought it was an accident.  Smoking in bed.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
Not really.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
You look great!
So?
Been up with Alice.
Something wrong with the stairs?
Excuse us, dear.
Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Is that who you're waiting for?
Who says I don't like you?
What do you mean?
But how...?
I was afraid you weren't coming.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Dad!
Thanks for everything, Dad.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
What's that got to do with it?
I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?
You had me scared on the phone.  What's wrong with the baby?
But how are we gonna --
You do good work, Alice.
I want to talk to both you guys about Greta.  And...
I couldn't do that, Mark.  He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
These things are wild...  What do you think?
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.
Vomit?
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
It's okay.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
You could train someone else.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
Reef!
What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
You've asked why I stay a bachelor? There goes the best reason I know!
I guess Skipper Neilsen re- tired before you enrolled at the Academy, didn't he?
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
And if I didn't <u>know</u> better - I'd swear we were moving!
What about down?
Course and speed?
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
The radiation level - from the saucer - it's rising!
I'm - afraid I have some bad news for you, Reef -  You'll have to share quarters, this trip.
Determine extent of damage, immediately.
That's a <u>face</u>???
My mission is to study various solar systems, and planets - select the most suitable for colonization -
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
See what?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
You plotted the course of Cyclops?  Then that's <u>our</u> course!  Wherever <u>he</u> goes, <u>we</u> go.....until we get him!
...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
You don't believe me?
No.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?
You heard the news.
You might not kill it.
Don't mind if I do.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
Like you and Gordon?
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
Saw him do it?
I'm fucking out of here.
Why do they do that?
But it's not funny now.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
It's pretty old.
What do you want, then?
Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing happened.
What the fuck. My day's already ruined.  Give me the keys. You can go back with Jack. You still got a shitload of plowing to do.
Something bugging you?
How you holding up, Wade?
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
You? Why?
Want to buy?
You okay?
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Money.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
Then... I guess you have to.
Strange.
Coffee's perked.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
It don't look right.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Why didn't you call and have the furnace fixed?
Yeah.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
What about Margie?
Find them everywhere. 
Which is?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
Mom?
Daddy...
It's some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
Got it.
Uh, we got a problem here.
They've got no chutes. They can't control the plane, their engines are failing and they're losing fuel.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
Please change course to Zero Seven Four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. Over.
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Remarkable aircraft. Remarkable.
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
We copy. Stand by...  Tower?
Up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the Mission Communication Center. The MCC, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  We're linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  We could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
*                     Please tell me your name.
My husband is a very courageous man.
Do you have to be so brutal?
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Someday, you'll regret my nature.
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
I'll not going without my family.
Call Petrov...  I'll be back.
Where's my family?
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
You wanna knock of f?
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.
Shit.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
Forget it.  I was reading.
What's the story?
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Ted!  What are you...?
Ted, we're taking off!
Elaine.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
Elaine!
Now!
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Can't we change course?
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
Captain Oveur?
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Striker.
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
You've been hurt.
Do you want to talk about it.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Captain, how soon can we land?
Can't you take a guess?
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
What did he have?
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
Roger.
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Do you feel all right, sir?
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
I like my horizons narrow.
You are Cassandra?
William Harcourt?
He didn't recognize me.
Let's talk Hubley.
What is wrong?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Back off, George.
How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
Which one is that?  Raw what?
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
I believe he is probably lying.
So, she keeps you on a pretty short leash, does she?
Was.  Divorced.
Human children can be very beautiful.  Getting married?  Congratulations. You will be taking Sunday off, then...
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
What was that about?
What's this nothing shit?  It wasn't nothing yesterday when you asked Bentner to run that test and he looked like he was about to shit peach pits, and it's not nothing now.  Don't lie to me, George, you're bad at it.
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
How potent?
Where did he get it?  Was there any of it on the ship?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
They had months in quarantine to develop the plan.  Porter, with his chemistry background, must have somehow come up with the formula for the drug.  Hubley manufactured it -- at the refinery.  Strader, through the nightclub, established a distribution network.  And Harcourt--
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.

With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find... Well, this is it.
You think this is the guy who did it?
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Here's Hubley.  Left Quarantine on November thirtieth, relocated first to Riverside, then moved to Los Angeles early in February the following year.  Field of expertise: chemical manufacturing.  Looks like he passed up several other better paying jobs waiting for that one at the refinery.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Granger and Pitts are already on it.
What?
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Okay, let's do it.
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
Ripley...
Have they located my daughter yet?
No.  There's no way!
Yeah, yeah.  I saw the commercial.
It's all I could get.  Anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  Days off are worse.
If I go.
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
You son of a bitch.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
One of us?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
How do you feel?
Are there any questions?  Hudson?
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
Seventeen meters.
Well you're not reading it right!
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
You know, Burke, I don't know which species is worse.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
Yeah, bullshit.  Watch us.
Man, we're not going to make it seventeen hours!  Those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they're going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
Thanks.
Well then somebody's just going to have to go out there.  Take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Can we dream?
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Maestro.
Oh!
Did you know? Had you heard?
What?
No, she's fine.
And how will you make him keep it?
Why what, sir?
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Where?
Why not?
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Yes, my love?
What?
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
Give me one reason I can understand.
Why not?
I will look at them, of course, the moment I can. It will be an honour. Please give him my warmest.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Really?
Then he didn't send you?
I see.
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
Tomorrow night I dine with the Emperor. One word from me and the post is his.
Why you?
How much will you pay him?
I'm paying people just to wait for you. It's ridiculous!
You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
He's adorable!
Behold!
Upstairs.
I've heard about you for ages! I thought you must be an old man.
It's such an honour for us to have you here, Herr Mozart. And for Gertrude.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
Sire.
Why not?
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
Oh, thank you.
Majesty!
Yes, where?
I don't understand. There are just as many notes, Majesty, as are required. Neither more nor less.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
Would you tell me why?
Well, what do you have for me today?
Do you always live like this?
Yes.
Why not?
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
What medicine?
Sssh!
What did he say? What did he say?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Put it down!
Yes.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
I'm afraid I am.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry. No.
Mio caro Adone.
Love, Sire!
Herr Sommer.
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
Do you have a daughter?
I can't say. Really
Wolfgang, what is it? Sta calmo, per favore. What's the matter?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
But what is it they don't like?
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
How long will you give me?
I don't have it yet. It's not finished. I'm sorry, but I need more time.
You mean she's not coming back?
What?
Shall I answer it?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Oh? Have I seen it?
Mozart! Herr Mozart, may I have a word with you please. Right away.
Did you not know that His Majesty has expressly forbidden ballet in his operas?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
What do you want?
About what?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
No, you didn't!
Are you absolutely sure?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
But he's all right?
I'll call tomorrow.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
What shall we do?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
I was. What are you reading?
I'm twenty-seven.
Now what do you want to talk about?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
The next corner we can get a cab.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Hello, Benjamin.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
I looked.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Who is this girl?
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Some, everyone does.
You're in a hospital in London.
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
How long have I been here?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I really don't know.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
That's a wolf's head.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Hello.
Right.
Go on, ask them.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Come on, where?
You really scared me, you shithead.
Nice to see you.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Shut up, you zombie!
You're not real.
What are you doing here?
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Get out of here, Jack!
A monster. I know, I know.
Jack, are you really dead?
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
What's the idea of turning her down? It sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
Personally, I think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. Dickson's all right.
What good will that do?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
Oh!
Thanks.
What were you doing at Finlay's this morning?
Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Why are you so anxious?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
If this isn't a red-letter day for Tom Dickson! First I trample on the Board of Directors, then I promote Matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day I have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. What a man, what a man!
Yes, of course.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Oh!
Yes?
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Got my letter?
But, Mr. Dickson, I thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. I only want ten thousand. The property is worth sixty.
Well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
Looks good. How much did it cost?
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
What's the matter? What's going on here?  This is ridiculous! You can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
Why pick on him ?
What time did this thing happen?
Of course it's true - and he knows it.
You're lying!
The lobby's half filled now.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
Look at them, Mr. Dickson. They're going crazy.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
The ten dollars.
No.
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
What's keeping you?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
No, Jimmy has a point. The Younger-James Gang could be confusing.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
How'd they --
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
How many of them did he kill?
You have no shame.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
Home, boys. Back to our farms.
She had a moustache.
It'll be the biggest score yet.
What are you saying?
Where'd you get all these riders?
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
BASTARDS! Come back here and face me!
You 'um big lawman?
Of St. Louis?
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
They're gone. What are you --
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Whyyyy... he took down the Gatling gun and the cannon all by himself.
"Big and older"?
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
You've killed your fair share of men.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
How much of that story is true?
Ma, I'm glad to see you being nice to our Injun friend.
Easterners.
Riders --
Doc Mimms will --
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Little ones.
Let the law --
Zee.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Hmm.
Aw, shucks, ma'am...
Tennessee?
You almost ended my career before it began.
Yes?
Not too young to shoot a man, not to young to drink.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Well, not exactly.
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
Well, this land is about to be condemned.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Really!
With my money!
What is that?
That.
This is him.
I want them arrested and hanged!
This is no game.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?
On a lot of lithium?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Dorsia's nice.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Pull out.
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
What are you doing tonight?
Patrick?
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Why don t you just go for Price?
He has a great body
Why? What's wrong?
But what about the past? Our past?
But where?
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Can I help you?
Carnes? Wait.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in London...just ten days ago.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
Patrick? Is that you?
Don't, I'll drink it.
Dorsia.
Dorsia, yes?
I said we are totally booked.
Oh, something. . romantic?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
Yes, Patrick?
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
Soooo...Dorsia is where Jean wants to go...
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
If you stay, I think something bad will happen. I think I might hurt you.  You don't want to get hurt, do you?
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Patrick? Is that you?
Where are you?
...to the office this afternoon.
Welt...it depends, why?
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Yeah.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Don't tell him you're here.
This tastes weird.  Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Coffee?
Your address?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
Where did Paul hang out?
Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
No hash browns?
He does? You're sure?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night.
I lost my job...
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
Listen, what's your name?
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
Is that a raincoat?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
You are a fanatic.
You don't wanna move, do you?
It isn't a broadcast studio. It's -- a surveillance post or something. That's why they have the dishes on top.
You think I don't know that?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
No. No. I sent an E-mail to somebody, just now. To tell her how I feel about you.  You know I'm clueless, without you. You know I --
...wanna savor this.
Right. Wait. A toast.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Will I get to work for Outpost?
Okay.
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
'Think I should buy some originals?
You did this -- overnight?
It scales, don't you think?
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
You could've handwritten it.
What'd the girl say?
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
We can't just assume they're standing by to receive Skywire 12 months from launch. I'd have to write in an aglet.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
Why were you snooping in my office?
'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
Great. I knocked off the aglet, as soon as I get a passable version of Skywire we're there.
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Oh.
They know, I had no choice. Get out of the house now! Do you have a laptop?
Maybe it's the satellite.
Is that how Larry feels?
Wanted to say goodbye to him...
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
I'm cool. They didn't touch the machine. Or my disks. Probably didn't know what they were. So, you a Moonie yet?  Milo?
What're they building?
Who're these guys?
Fellas, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave here now.
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Come in.
In Japan, men come first and women come second.
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
Hungry.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Hello, Austin, this is Basil Exposition from British Intelligence. Thank you for confirming the link between Dr. Evil and Virtucon. Find out what part Virtucon plays in something called Project Vulcan. I'll need you and Vanessa to get on that immediately.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking your head space.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
My meat and two veg.
Do I make you horny?
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
Fancy a nibble?
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Really, Austin!
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Hello, luv.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a rancid taste in my mouth. Do you have a piece of gum?
What do we do now?
I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
Austin, I'm coming with you.
One credit card receipt for Swedish- made penis enlarger pump, signed Austin Powers.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is--  --work with this tennis ball. Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...
We've got a lot of work to do.
Quite impressive.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave. Thank you. OK, group, we have two new member. Say hello to Scott and his father, Mr.... Ehville?
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
Hi.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.
Oh, hello Vanessa. How was the flight?
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
Fear ...
I so agree. How did you acquire a taste for it?
May I help you, madam ...
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Quite a collection.
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
What are you trying to do to me?
An unholy trinity ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Such as?
The missing piece of the jigsaw. I tried to get you to give it to me as Peter; I tried to steal it from you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll be a bit less subtle.  With this ring my plan will be complete.
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire someone who doesn't play by the rules.
Much better.
I didn't. Mother did.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
Steed, we really must be --
I have no choice. Why should you risk your life?
No thanks.
I wasn't about to.
What on earth?
For you, Mrs. Peel.
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
This must be the last straw.
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
To kill me?
And do you trust me?
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
There's a reception this evening. Colonel Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
What is it?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
No bother. Mother and Father think I've joined you. I might as well.
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel. With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
I was getting to it.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Privately owned by ...
We know one thing. That suspect was not Mrs. Peel.
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
Amnesia?
Insane ... ?
We had a lead to Wonderland Weather but we got there too late. Someone tipped them off ...
Wonderland Weather Ltd.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Seventy-five hundred.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
I love that car.
Fine. How's everything going?
Nice shot.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
No, Cole, I...
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
I don't believe you.
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Your whores never showed up.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Let's go.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
What the hell are you doing?
Oops!
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
You've been having strange sex...!
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
I'm not really hungry.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Right in there, pal.
How'd it go?
Hey, you guys...
You're late again, Rick.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Biggest in two battalions.
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
Ah, everybody screws up some, Brian. You're working for the toughest Lt. on the job. Saw him once pick up a probie he thought was moving too slow and throw him into a burning building. It's just bad luck you're family.
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Ready?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and...  Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
What is --
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
Right. Light smoke, low roll. Couple'a civilians hollering -- medium deal. So young fireman Adcox and Captain McCaffrey, they head up stairs, get out on the fire escape -- McCaffrey does the ballsy jump across... what were you feeling, Brian?  C'mon, you promised. Be honest.  Okay... Guard!
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
Where are you going?
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
I don't guess.
Did I say thanks?
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Yeah. Big fan.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
I have a job.
Mr. McCaffrey...
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Who's going to die?
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Where's Sean?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
Yeah... I just thought I should say, I don't know, something.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
They ran the residue you scraped from both crispers' front doors. It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum. Burns almost completely away when you light it.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
You don't know him.
-- Burn them.
...He wasn't listening to the right thing...
Is there a connection between them, Alderman?
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
People.
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Hey, man. Don't give me that bullshit. Don't pussy-out on me. The Mets are a fucking lock. I wanna make some money.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Do you have the money?
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
How's the case going?
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
The Mau-Mau's are up in dis place. That's right, the Mau-Mau's.
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
Seconds and thirds, too.
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
I'm out.
So that's what you been doing?
You can walk away.  We both can.
What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time?
Nice to meet you.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
Yo, you gotta show some patience. You want me to snap my fingers and presto chango - you're an overnight sensation.  Son, there is no such thing.
My tap shoes.
What do I have to do?
How different?
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
I would like to change your name.
I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.
Delacroix, wake up, brother man. The reason why they didn't get picked up was because nobody - and I mean NOBODY - niggers and crackers alike wants to see that junk.
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
The name of the show?
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet.
And every week these Alabama porch monkeys will make us cry, make us laugh, make us look at our own humanity.  Make us feel good to be alive.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
Go away, unless you got my money.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
So what's up with you?
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.
How did you know?
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
What is this?
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
This is crazy.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
Don't make me have to use this.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
You feel good, not nervous?
So they can be on TV.
What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Where are you from?
Finland.
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
Money and nothing else?
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
A lot?
So what's up with you?
The good stuff.
What else?
You don't read, do you?
You're sure this is a good idea.
You leave something out?
And?
Where are you bound for?
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
What is the service, sir?
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Good gracious!  What is this?
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
I have no luggage.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Who else can give me information about you?
No.
Not even that.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Charming Schuvaloff.
Bill Styles...
What about Pike?
Hey, I --  Holy fuck... holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
West was one thing, but this --
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
And he'd been shot.
You shot Childs and Nunez.
We're not finished yet --
We don't need the tapes --
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Where?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
What the fuck is going on?
Jesus, what happened?
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
Why?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
I... I don't know...
Okay. I think that's it. He rises and walks to the door.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life --
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Something funny, Levi?
How are you?
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
You mean not enough to save you.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
Stay where you are.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
Something like that. You?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
That was kid gloves?
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
I didn't shoot West...
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
What?
Why don't you talk to Levi off the record for a second?
I pushed him too hard.
Do I have a choice in this?
Nah.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --
I don't think I want to hear this --
He said what?
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
Dunbar's telling the truth.
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Thank God...
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
So?
What do you think?
You want Kendall, don't you?
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
I have to leave. Tonight.
You get the eye?
How long have you known my father?
How would you describe him?
Yeah.
You must be Edward Bloom.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...  I am in love with my wife.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Spooning the sherbet.
You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
You're not trying to run away?
Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
There was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when I came out of this coffee shop near the office.
When did you ever work in an office?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Son?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing lies. Stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. They're not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. And the thing is, I believed you. I believed your stories so much longer than I should have. And then when I realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- I felt like such a fool to have trusted you. You were like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined. Just as charming and just as fake.
Where are we headed?
You don't even know me.
Wait! I need those!
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
So what are you up to now?
This is it? The whole vault.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
You didn't become crazy.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
You have to understand. When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. And I started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. With another house, another family. He leaves us, he goes to them. Or maybe there is no family. Maybe he never wanted a family. But whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. And the reason he tells all those stories is because he can't stand this boring place.
How did you get here?
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
How much time does he have left?
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
Yeah it was okay.
That's not a burn.
What? What are you doing?
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
Yes. I know.
When?
Binoculars.
Do you believe in love?
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
I don't understand.
They go.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
So what are you going to do?
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
In every sense. If at all possible.
What?
So uh...
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You are throwing me out.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
Nobody's that unhappy.
Yeah. No thanks.
Something else.
It's not mine.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
You have excellent English.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Is your niece older than 12?
When? Now? Oh. No.
I lied to you. It was wrong. But at the time... I didn't know what to do. Imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal I's carryin'...
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Mind I ask, what's all this business here?
Still need a lift?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
The fuck you laughin' at?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
I keep the heat on.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
You some kind'a pervert?
Now you get up! And you get in my house!
I said... STOP!
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
What'chu sayin'?
She a freak. Got what you call a sexual addiction.
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
You ever seen a train run on a woman?
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Goin' dove huntin'?
Why don't you go'on and ask her. She need to talk wit somebody with sense. Folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. And this is how I'm handling it.
Good. Makin' steaks for supper. I expect you to come.
Pass them potatoes, Lincoln.
Mm. MM. Now these eggs got some kick to it. What'chu got in this?
You won't at the square this mornin'.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Yeah. I know I did. But...  I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
You got any money?
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
What's this?
Why?
What are they doing now?
Frank Abolofia.
... Detective Ich-iro Matsu-moto. Hey, we're getting Mr. Moto on our side.
This should be it...
Getting very weird.
Now that's the kind of motorcycle I want to see you on.
Squid?
It's getting too cold even for me, Nick.
Nick!
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
Broiled fish paste cake, Kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
If I smell one drop of Scotch on your breath, my friend --
I'm not drunk...
Nick --
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
It's very small.
No...
Joyce?
You can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
Don't be an ass.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
And I'm supposed to care?
They want your autograph.
Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
It's not your job.
How?  You don't know the place.  You don't know the language.  Get on the plane.
What's this?
Hey...!  HEY, I'M TALKING TO YOU, INSPECTOR!
Seven years work by the finest engraver.  Mass produced, sequentially numbered.  The best there has ever been, Mr. Conklin.
Why tell me this?
If I say no?
That wasn't our deal.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
One man.  He must be good.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
Yeah.  It might be better if we talk in private, Sebastian.  Why don't you go home.
But not to last.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
What generation are you?
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
What's going on down there?
I was just about to have my dinner.
She was gonna get away.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Well, when do you get paid?
What about a summary then.
Number three.
I like you.
How old am I?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
Let's hear it.
What's that?
Nerves of steel.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
What if you change your mind?
You sure?
My job is here.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
Yeah?
How do you mean 'exploited'?
The best.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
Is there anything else?
Do I make you nervous?
They probably want to find out when they were made.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Thanks.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
But in your profession that is a risk.
Well?
You're not responding to the stimulus.  I can see right here, I'm not getting a reading.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
How come you were in my truck?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
What about friends?
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
What makes you think so?
You're kidding!
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Why are you doing that?
Thank-Q!
I think it's the eyes.
What's fair?
Very funny, smart ass.
I don't want to be alone.
It didn't used to be that way.
One who's not a mutant.
Get out!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
He has a computer?
About clothing?
Hey, Eve!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Really?
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
Eve?!
I know first aid!
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
Is this because of the radiation?
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
How do I leave here?
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
Like one of Mom's?
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
That's what everybody believes?
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
It's so small.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Does that work?
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
How old are you?
You don't look thirty-five.
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Elbows, Son.
I'm afraid you've got to.
Right.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Well, put it down and come in!
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
You hear that?!
The locks?
To go up.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
You have tranquilizers?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
What did you wish for, Adam?
Let's eat our cake.
Yes, yes it is!
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
Yes.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
You're serious, aren't you?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
He go back to the hotel?
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Gay.
What do you want to do with it?
And if we can't find him?
To get some frozen poultry.
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
Adam!!
Tower, say again!!
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
Are you Detective Williams?
By the way, Jeffrey, this story isn't going to the press and I'm going to ask you to consider all you've heard strictly confidential. Do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. Got it?
Come into the study a minute.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
What is this? What color is it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Okay?
Who knows you have these?
Yes? What is it?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Do you like the way I feel?
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
No. What is happening?
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from, but I like you.
Falling.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
Do you love me?
I didn't mean to hurt you.
Dorothy. No!
Oh no.
Bull.
He's comin' back? What for?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Look at these. What are these?
Can I feel 'em?
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
On a ride.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
Well.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Yeah, how did you know?
Oh yeah?
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
What's the plan.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
Okay, thanks.
You want to tell me about it?
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Who, me? Why should it?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
You were late.
What am I going to do?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey? Why?
Everything okay?
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Dorothy!... Dorothy!
I don't know why we have to watch TV.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
What did he bring him in for?
Up where?
Are ya ready?
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Anybody you think is evil?
Yeah, well...
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
Look again for fuck sake!
Shit.
You little fuck. Let him go. I'll drop you right here.
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
me up the...
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
So what do you think?
Give the guy a shot.
He isn't to be touched.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
What?
So what are you thinkin' here?
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
Well, Freud was right. So you think they came for the fag man, huh? And what do you base this upon?
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
A couple of peons for the mob and...
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Hello?
Roc. You okay?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
Worst day of my life, man.
Hello? You there?
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
You gonna do what I say, got it?
I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see this. Don't look at me!
Just be natural, goddamit.
Continue the joke.
Well, it's the funny man. Give it here, package boy.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
Making Hutch David Soul?
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
This is he?
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Dignan, calm down.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
There's another stocker, right?
Is that the manager?
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
See if mine are in there.
Yes, they are.
I'll just say it.
OK. Go ahead.
Which one was that?
He told you and you let him do it.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
I have an idea for that.
I think we better go home.
Our money situation is not good.
You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
When'd you get back?
You could give somebody a concussion.
He doesn't want to fight.
Next week we'll be drinking pia coladas.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
He was a nice guy.
Do you like Inez?
We all set?
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
Help me move him.
What?
You got to be kidding me.
Does it float?
No. I'm not.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
Sure, sure. He's a great person, and I'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. But I wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
How does that feel?
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
Are you afraid?
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
Could you grow cinnamon?
See you.
You think he got my license plates?
How long are they going to hold him?
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Jesus, Bob.
What?  What?
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
Where'd they come from?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965. It's famous. Applejack was the wheel man. Did you use this same car, Applejack?
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
No.
They are.
You stole a Trans-Am.
OK, Bob.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
The guy is fucking insane.
He doesn't get it. Held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. It's too dangerous for him.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
Did we get it?
You really think he'll remember you?
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
Just get in the car, Bob.
I can't fucking believe this guy. An apology, Bob?
Come on!
Come on, Bob.
What's wrong with Applejack?
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
How long do you have to go?
Is he in?
Why?
He left his sweater.
You a good pool player.
What?
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
That's not gonna fly.
And what are we looking for?
I want to know what happened.
Sorry to wake you.
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
I don't exactly know what to say -- I'm sorry.
She say what time I should call?
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
Something's been going on here in Europe. And it's still going on. Post Conklin. Who's been in Berlin?
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.
They loved you.  And I killed them.
Because you're afraid!
I have to go now.
Front. Use your teeth.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
So...
That's crazy.
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
I did.
I know it's a dream.
Say it.
A Russian?
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
My first job.
Who?
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
Show me.
What kind of problems?
Good luck.
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
What do you think? Is he coming in?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Young Robert, we are honored --
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
Longshanks promised!
What news of the north?
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Now we kill two birds at one stroke. We recruit from Scotland for our armies in France.
Shut up, would you! How can I concentrate?!
Good day to you, M'Lords.
The little cow is insane --
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
Stephen ready?
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
They're coming!
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
I sent for him -- and the little coward send you?!
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Treason. Against whom?
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
I want... to marry you!
I'm dreaming.
I am the Princess of Wales.
M'lady... what kindness of you to visit a stranger.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
War finds me willing. I know it won't bring back all I have lost. But it can bring what none of us have ever had -- a country of our own. For that we need a king. We need you.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Why? What for?
Unfortunately, we've got nothing to work with. It's harder playing detective now.
If I had to guess, I'd say the blackouts are stress related.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
Actually, these tests weren't available twenty years ago.
No dances, just tell me.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
You know the answer to that.
Please, mom. People will talk.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
What does that mean for Evan?
There must be a way to fix this.
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
So when I'm out, I need you to watch my face and hands closely.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?
Hey, Evan. What's the big rush? We don't meet for another hour.
Are you stupid or what?
Whasamatter? Lost your Rolex?
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
Because you're... different.
I just thought you should know.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
Then you think it might have worked out?
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
It didn't feel like a dream.
I couldn't cut the rope.
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Are you sure you even packed it?
What?
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Monsieur Rick?
I should have known.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
And you want to know --
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
Here's to you, sir.
Er, goodbye, sir.
What do you want for Sam?
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Do you know where they are?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
Yes?
Yes, of course, we --
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
That's too far ahead to plan.
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
I didn't count the days.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
But Richard, no, I, I --
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Where is Rick?
When will he be back?
This time they really mean to stop me.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Yes?
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Are you ready Ilsa?
Hello, Rick.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
Good morning.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
No. It's all arranged.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
I believe you have a message for him?
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
And that is?
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
Mademoiselle.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
This is the end of the chase.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
Sam's piano.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Are my eyes really brown?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
He'll double what I pay you.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
What's that you're playing?
It's bad.
Nobody remembers that.
Thirsty.
Do too little you'll die.
Get water!
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
Oh?  You've tried?
To tell you the truth -- you did.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
Did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
You?  Personally?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Four four.  A record.
Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
This isn't working out.
There isn't any us.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
If I'd known you were alive --
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
So simple to say, so hard to do.
My favorite doctor.  What's the verdict?
Need some help?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
When'd you start working here?
Trying.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
And never take.
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
This stinks really bad.
Cool ropes.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.
Thanks.  For everything.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
These *credentials* are against the law!
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
Why not?
And that I can drive a truck!
I've never seen a lobster.
So. Not bored yet?
A movie *outside*?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
You don't miss it?
How could you not *care* about the movie?
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
How is that Wally doing?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
Wally thinks apples are boring.
Her temperature is a hundred and four.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do *you* do the--
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Where are you going?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
There was no visible wound?
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
What I mean is... I would like it very much if you thought you could be happy here, Homer.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Rose Rose?
What's that?
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
You're not yet three months, are you?
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
That's *it*?
Shit. We don't know what he is.
I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
I told him that you all is sick.
That what happen--you lost you only daughter so's you killed yourself! That's what we say, all right.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
What do you do over at your bank, Grant?
Well, typically speaking, they're not. As long as you can demonstrate --
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
It can erase all those things about you that you wish didn't exist.
Grifters...
I'm not saying anything. Besides, you're one to talk. You're the one who's got me on my knees in a dark alley.
So how'd you get caught?
We were back on.
Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
We'll take care of it.
Who's that?
Whoa. What?
I'm going home
What? I can feel you looking at me.
How much we going after?
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
Calls?
You ever use the bathroom in Kennedy?
Minus one.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
That's more than you already owe me. What happens if you fuck this up?
Listen, Scooter --
Come here. Feel this.
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
What the hell's his problem?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
He was looking out for you.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
Did, uh... Did you kill him?
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Your mess.
It's bad luck.
Uh...
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Stand up.
Sorry. What?
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
I don't doubt your talent. You looking for that place in the hall of fame?
If you Feds are so hot for him, why don't we just bring him in right now?
You sell it.
You're shaking.
I hate cheats.
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
What kind of deal you looking to?
How about fifteen hundred?
She went back to South Africa.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
I don't gamble.
Good night?
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
You're my prisoner.
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
Are you trying to read my palm?
What's the time?
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Without hope there's no point to anything.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Here...use a spoon.
Why did you take the money?
What?
Yes, I know that.
I've lived there.
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
How did you hurt your hand?
And I thought you were only after my body.
What'll you do when it all goes wrong?
I'm sorry.
It doesn't seem fair. You're offering me ten grand in cash but you can't afford a decent place.
I don't think we should meet again.
Detective Inspector Ross.
Of course I recognised him!
You've been avoiding me.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
Look Matt, there's something I have to say to you. I saw you cheating.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Girlfriend?
You can start Monday week.
The key, goddamit, the key!
It didn't go off.
What was that, I didn't hear...
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
Do you remember the detonation time?
Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb, arm yourself.
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Hey, bomb...
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
It is intuitively obvious.
This is fun.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
In a second.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
You know, Talby, you really ought to eat with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
Waves would be peaking really high and glassy. Hit that water. Ridin' the wall just perfect.
Yes sir. Negative effect.
That's correct, sir.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
I already have, sir, and Pinback is talking to it now.
Sir?
Oh, yeah?
Or we can work on your face with a pair of pliers for a couple of hours and you tell us where she is.
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Which is none of your business...or mine.
I'll make it worth your while.
You're light a deuce.
Damn... Are you alright?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
Thank God.
I was expecting someone else.
I'm sorry if I caught you at a bad time.
Who is...
Sorry about your window.
Lemme get my coat.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
So what are you gonna do about it?
How do I know you didn't?
Am I s'posed to be grateful?
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Yeah...a made-up creature.  Like in mythology...with the head of a lion, the body of a goat and the tail of...
Your basic hodge-podge.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
I'm sorry.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
What do you want?
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
As long as you're okay.
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
That's odd...
No.
Yeah.
Because you're probably my closest friend in the whole world.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Not right now.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Do guys actually believe their lame, self- serving excuses?
Really?
And you were a sympathetic ear.
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
Okay, okay, okay--
What about this?
Well. Obviously no one you have to worry about... Woody.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
What's that?
Whoa... she is a killer.
Beth? I can't believe it.
We've got to take this slow...
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.
Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?
So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what?
Sunday, but...
What the fuck!
Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
If he offers you a slice, you're not the least bit hungry, check?
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
I got...
Grounded for the rest of the year?
Jeremiah... what's gotten into you?
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Simplicity, Hawk.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Man, that weed knocked Christine on her ass. She's sleeping like a baby stella.
I did?
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
What was his name?
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie? He stinks.
Why did you make me flood the school?
DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Where are we going?
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
So, we call them... IMGs.
What? How long was I asleep?
Will you please talk to me?
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
No. Frank.
Is that a cellar door?
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
People aren't that simple.
Grandma Death.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Who's been giving you weird looks?
Who is Frank?
Where are you going?
Cellar door.
Follow him where?
And when I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
Who is the boss?
What about your family, Donnie?
Is Callie still around?
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
People get hurt.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
Yes. I went to jail.
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
Regret.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
I think you are afraid to ask me for advice. I think that you are a very troubled... confused young man. I think you're searching for answers in all the wrong places.
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Kitty, I would appreciate... if you could wait...
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
Wicked.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
Hell-no, she ain't quittin'.
You-betcha.
Oh, Mom's okay. They're just givin' her a ride back. She almost blew outta the back of Loretta's pick-up on the way over.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
Loretta, don't do that.
I gotta work with these women.
Shut up, yous guys. Look, Amber, I'm not gonna win. And let's be honest, a family only needs one "Liza" and you know Peter's got much better legs than me.
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Amber...
Oh shit!
Mom!
That's it, I'm goin'...
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
This, this... This is bullshit!
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
Are we on "Cops" again?
You don't know where this is gonna...
We was robbed.
Annette, just use your hand.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
The bitch.
And the year before that?
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
So help me, Gladys.
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
Ow, Harold -- Mom said not the head.
I will if you shut your piehole.
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
Who to?
In her dressing room?  Why, what could he be doing there?
I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
What do you whistle?
That was for you.
Oh no, I can't do it.
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
No, but I shot some ducks.
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
Then I demand an apology!
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
You keep that up and you'll crab the whole war.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
Are you sure you're not tired?
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Give me that again!
Then it's war?
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Oh, Rufus!
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
One or two?
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
You won't be long?
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
What happened?
Never mind that, I want my man!
He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
Now I think we really do understand one another.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Has the response picked up?
Don't you think this is a bit premature? We don't have the backing yet to...
I'm feeling very fit, thank you. How is your bronchitis?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
Fair Katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady's ear And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Why, Mr. Merrick, you're not an Elephant Man at all...
Of course! You want out?
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
I'll have to find some more.
Yes!
...Yes potatoes... but...
Good evening. How are you feeling?
How long will I stay here?
John... what's the matter? John... why are you upset?
Good morning, John.
No John, I can't. I can care for you, but I can't cure you.
Mr. Treves! Treves.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
Won't come out, eh?
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
So you see, John, there's no need for a lighthouse. All your friends are here.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
HE'S GONE!
I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
It's all right! It isn't happening!
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
WHAT did you say?
WELCOME?
Please! Please! What are those?
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
Do you believe I love you?
You don't have to love me. Just: do you believe I love YOU?
Blow the third note! The note to take us home!
Then I shall come too.
How do we know this is the way?
Is there nothing men can do?
How?
Er... well... we... we... would be TERRIBLY grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
We're just not a very musical nation...
He's trying to stop us waking the Gods.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
But it IS! Look!
What about the raping?
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
I don't suppose... no...
About NOT raping you...
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Louder.
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.
Why?
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?
Is THAT Odin?
Why should you care?
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
How deep IS the ocean?
Let's hack her to pieces.
We're missing all the fun...
You talking piffle, son?
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.
Slower! In... Out...
Thank you VERY much indeed.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
That's better.
Weren't we supposed to?
You'll be sucked down too!
What's the matter with them?
I think we should go...
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
What are you talking about, Erik?
But HOW?
I came to find my grandfather.
Bye, Leif.
It can't do you any HARM...
How did he do that?
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
He used to puke in his sleep.
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Get away, Snorri.
Together we stand!
Wasn't it, Keitel?
Urrgh! Argh! Let go, you idiot!
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
I must KILL! Kill!
Shut up.
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
Yeah.
Who was the girl you walked off with?
You rat.
Come up to Boston with me?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I can't remember.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
Huckleberry Hound?
Yeah.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
Take care.
Ready for another?
What do you want to hear?
Thanks.
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
I don't think we're ready.
What?!
You're drunk.
Such a beautiful view.
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
I scoured the city for it.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
I told her today I need to end it.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
You know what I did.
Oh God, how horrid.
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Me too. There's this poem --
I think, before.
Bye, Joel.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
I think I should go back.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
Yeah?
It was snowing.
It's them.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
How's the chicken?
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
Okay. I wish you could come.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
Stan... c'mon...
See you later, alligator.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
He's coming?
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Howard, your one o'clock.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
You made me have an abortion.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
Mary. What are you doing here?
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
Oh, hi.
Yeah?
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
What was that?
What do you believe in then?
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
Where are the others?
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Tell me about it.
No, I guess not.
Extraordinary!
What do you think?
Going north?
Hitchhiking?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
That means top-secret, Cooper.
Time to play Spam in the can.
...come on, Skipper, I already put my shoes on...
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
What?
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
Damn, Dr. Weir, don't scare us like that. Coffee?
Coffee.
The Event Horizon only had life support for eighteen months. It seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... I have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
Is that an offer?
Can you shut it down?
He's a rescue technician. Peters, medical technician. DJ...
How is he?
To conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. Anyone who can should get some sleep.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead.
Please... kill...
What's wrong?
What's happening...?
What's wrong?
Incredible... These are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? This isn't some kind of hoax?
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
I want our best people on this. Where's Miller?
What does?
I've reached another containment door. This thing's huge...
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Okay. We do it the hard way. Deck by deck, room by room. Starck, deploy the umbilicus. I believe you're up for a walk, Mr. Justin. Go get your bonnet on.
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
Since the initial transmission, there's been no further contact. Just the beacon, every two minutes.
Jesus its huge.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
I found one.
Can anybody hear me...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
That's a negative, Starck.
Peters. We need to know what happened to the crew. Before it happens to us.
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
No one?
It beats dying, Mister Smith.
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
Is that your "expert opinion?" The only answer we've had out of you is "I don't know."
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
We're leaving.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
You can't leave. She won't let you.
Your eyes...
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
But...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
We're past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you're ready.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
What I want is to survive the next ten hours.
Miller, come in...
Here's another one. They're all over the place.
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
If they are, they're screening their calls.
The scope is lit, it's right in front of us...
The reactor's still hot. We've got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. Nothing serious.
What is it?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I'm not really dressed for a party.
You know, you could'a run an ad in the personals.
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
He didn't.
What are you doing here?
About me? How sweet.
Ben, come in.
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Deb... It's me. I need you to step out front.
What did you wish for, honey?
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
We had a tough year.
You got a chisel round here?
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Where... where am I?
No more cracks about how I look.
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
He's not responsive --
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
What is that thing?
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
They're ready for you, sir.
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
That's good. That's uh... good.
For science.
It has to be the cloud. It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
I could get Ben to tap into the Baxter's main power to generate enough voltage --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
Not until Ben is back inside!
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
But I'm not done with the machine --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
What's going on?
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
Please don't make this personal --
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Hamilton, come over here. What is that you've got on?
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
Come on, Hamilton. You're going over there to represent Captain Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores all over Southern California. Part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. You know that!
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
Hey, Rat.
Yo.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
Not if you're over sixteen.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
What's going through your mind right here, Jeff? The danger of it all?
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
My brother's car!
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Does that ever happen?
How long does Doug take?
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Sometime?
Mr. Spicoli?
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Thanks for picking me up.
Where do you feel like going?
What's your other question?
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
This is a nice car.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
Where's Mike today?
What about the notes?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
Naked!?
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
He wanted the pineal gland.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
Oh, Jesus! Did you see what god just did to us?
How long do I have?
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
I want to leave fast.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
Where'd you get that knife?
You evil son of a bitch. You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble.
Not me. It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it!
The cops?
You degenerate pig!
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
The only alternative was to take her out to the desert and feed her remains to the lizards. But, it seemed a bit heavy for the thing we were trying to protect: My attorney.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
Okay, Lucy, it's time to go meet Barbra...
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
This is a fucking nightmare.
Like big lizards.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
Extract of pineal!
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
Stop!
I will not die because of him!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
Oh!
You seem mighty collected about this.
Ohhh.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!
How are you holding up?
Will I go crazy or something?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
You wanna see, baby?
How much you got to see the show?
My husband...
He's dead.
What's it for!?
Is it gassed up?
Open?
How many?
Bullshit.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
Got 'cha!
Shit!
JUST A BAT! I'M FINE! JUST A BAT! SORRY!
Yeah, maybe.
Well, maybe they migrate?
Okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
Let's move.
Let's wait it out.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Hold it!
Cody! Cody are you all right? Mommy's coming! Mommy's coming, baby! Don't move! Mommy's coming!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
We should stick together out there.
Do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Frances?  Oh no.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
Well... you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe. Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who don't give a damn about politics.
Oh. I mean, good.
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Oh my God! Frances, I'm such a cad. I can't go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. I can't ask you to...
...Not only an artist, but an instrument of change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
Where's Clifford?
Get your clothes on, lady --
Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
New York, Frances! Broadway! This is your chance! You belong on the stage!
Were you an alcoholic?
Bye, baby.
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
I'm going back to the hotel.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Kurt!
Name?
Age?
Address?
Okay then...
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
How'd I look?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Harry... I met someone.
Some people starve, kid. Until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes 'em feel better.
Don't start, Farmer.
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
I love you, Harry. I love you.
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Pretty morning.
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
That's me, Clifford.
'But how do I know you love me?'
But they're using you!
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Well, who have we here...?
How long will you be?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
At one. Promise?
I'm back, Mama.
No!
Mama, shut up!
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
I don't believe so.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Huh?
Is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure hate to use that word.
I am as he made me. In his own image.
Nice.
It can't be as bad as that.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
What can I do?
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Are you all right?
He always was opinionated.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
How could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
Don't listen, Willie. Progress is a feast to be consumed. Women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. Or run before you can waltz!
Father's so proud.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
This feels... incestuous.
Brother and sister still?
I wish to be your wife.
I give you my soul...
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
It was misguided and pointless. Is your answer yes?
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Professor?
Henry Clerval.
Do you really think I'm mad?
Only you would think of that!
You're making a scene!
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
For what?
What happened up there?
I have always loved him.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Re-configure the leads?
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
I heard.
Creature? A... human like creature?
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.
Good night, Alice.
Cabin B is ready.
Alice? The others show up?
I didn't know I was asleep... What time is it?
You can only do what you can do.
Trouble?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Why don't we run? Just run now?
Somebody's there, Barry.
Let's go back, Barry...
Give me a hand?
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
Holy shit...
Jack?
Steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. The town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
I love you.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Mmmmmmmph?
I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
How much do I owe you?
What is your purpose in Mexico?
What was that?
You said it was just you and your son.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Twenty-eight.
Have you forgotten about your sister?
What about Kate?
You don't believe in suicide.
Yes.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
Then?
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
It's the bitterest of pills.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
It has a bed. That's all I care about.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
Not good enough, swear to God.
I'm going for 'em!
Mexico.
You're gonna let us go?
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
-- you got your sink --
Awww, it's just been a shitass day. Every inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin' the grill. That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by ten thirty.
Well, if there ain't there sure oughta be. Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid's mind?
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
Were you giving that pig signals?
He says you were scratching.
Whiskey!
What dya mean?
What the fuck is wrong with you --
Gotcha!
How's it feel?
What'd ya see?
No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Keep your voice down.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.
Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!
I'm lookin' scared?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
The woman I saw you with...
But are there... I mean, how many...
Got it.
Wow...
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Ah, c'mon...
Shit.  Think we're had.
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
Can't complain, ma'am.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Wickwire was there to help.  To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot.  At least that was the intent.
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
Come on, Montgomery...
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
I'll try anyway, sir.
The Navy Cross...
Chances of recovery?
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
I've been trying you for five days. Don't they give you messages?
That bad?
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
Which is guy-speak for...
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
At first.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Permission to get dressed, sir?
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.
Thought you two were file-closed.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Me!? You where the one...
That why you dumped him?
My God. He's going after the nest.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So you made it.
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
I still can't believe it. How does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?
You'd be surprised.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
Can I use some?
Did you talk with Humphries?
Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace.
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
When we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
It's the French Secret Service.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
I think we should leave now.
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
You WILL go out there.
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
Oh my god, It's real.
May I get the check?
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
I don't know.
I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
No, wait, are you-
Shit! Go!
Structural damage at 68 percent.
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
Hey Commander. Listen, we found some Beryllium on a nearby planet. We might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. What do you think?
A hologram...
No, I'll kill you. .
Where are the miners?
Oh, they're so cute.
Your last name.
It's... I don't know.
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
We~re oetting hammered, Jason.  Return fIre?
You have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
We're alive!
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
We're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
All right... here's the plan:  First, Fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then Gwen, Alex, Fred and I go down to get the sphere.  Any of those things come back, give a signal. Guy, you set up a perimeter.
How does the rolling help, actually?
What?  What did he say?
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
That's it, It's go time.
You should have let me hit him.
Oh my god! Tommy! Stop the pod! Stop the pod!
We got the Sphere but the Commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  Teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
I heard it too.
First, I require the Omega 13... Second-
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Commander?... Where are you... going?
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
But what if Sarris survives?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
The ship is a model... As big as this!... A very clever deception indeed! He oan't oontaln hIs lauchter.  A belle-----TOMMY Set a course for home, lommander?
That's right... Just keep shaking it out... Here, have some gum, It helps.
Excuse me?
Okay... On what?
Go for the eyes. Like in episode 22 with-
NO NO NO.
Hold course, Laredo!
Arnold!
Why in hell would John do that? Why in hell would any of them do that?  After all you've done, it's unbelievable!
Go on... I want to hear everything.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
I am to take command of Major General Lafayette's division and lead the attack.
How old are you, Captain?
Excuse me, General, but may I ask how do you feel?
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
This is a declaration of insurrection!  Who wrote this!?
George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
I doubt Arnold will be afraid.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
What do you mean you're not a Christian?  Of course you're a Christian, we're all Christians...
George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
These supplies...?
And how rusty are these muskets?
Like flowers after the snow melts.
What is it, Marquis?
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
The day Tom Jefferson frees a slave I'll ride naked through the streets of Williamsburg on a mule.  Tom Jefferson is one of those people who talks big and acts small.  The only man out there who really does what he says is Sam Adams and everyone thinks he's crazy.  Believe me, this 'disturbance' isn't going to last long.  You have to understand, congress is a chicken coop full of foxes, Martha, each and every one has his eye on a nice, fat prize.
That's right...
To win this war I need an army.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
Sir, I have to act on instructions from you ordering thirty copies of your own dress uniform...
Well, this must be about something!
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
George, you know I only love you, but...
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Where... do those men come from, George?
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
Yes!
The land here is best for grain and corn.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
Trade for what?
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
In just a second. Two...
I'm working on a few things.
C-18.
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
I'm looking at you.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
I want you to.
You mean, Leo?
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
Really? You ever been arrested?
What's it called?
The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
Just a thought.
You don't even know these guys.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
What?
Here's your keys, Harry.
Really.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
So you want to know.
I'm thinking of a movie.
How about this?
You're here a while, what's wrong with a bank?
You've been losing.
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
It's not one of these?
You saw that one?
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Harry told me Martin loves it, he flipped.
You and Harry'll make a great team.  I'm gonna make a deal with him.
I was never much into it. All that bullshit having to do with respect. It's bad enough having to treat those guys like they're your heroes, having to smile when they make some stupid remark they think's real funny.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
I don't know, I'm just havin' some trouble seeing you two together.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
I don't know.
I'll be right back.
I told you not to -
He already knew it.
Yeah? What three words, Harry?
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
What a spectacular view.
When I came upstairs, you stayed to finish your drink. I told you to turn off the TV when you were through.  Come to think of it, I also told you you could sleep in the maid's room.
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.
Which two?
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
I'm sitting here, I'm looking at you and I'm having these flashes. You know, flashbacks, of memories.  Of us.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over.
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
The turbine blew.
This's gonna hurt a little.
What other choices have we got?
Smokes?
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
Yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. But we got half the Bering Sea and the whole Alaskan gulf to drag her over.
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
Mother fucker!
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
How much longer's that gonna take?
How long?
Obviously it's some kind of screw up. The shipping records aren't a hundred percent accurate.
Went aboard.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
What if that fucker finds it before we're ready to go?
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Damn barbaric is what it is.
Can't you use something else?
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
Yeah, well. The truth is one thing. When there's more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that's a whole new deal.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
You're late.
You mean, before she sank.
Sudden flashes of light.
Candy?
Go on.
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Coffee?
She was sailing up north, right?
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
No cowboy shit up there, understand?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
You're saying they mutinied for the gold?
The same day she supposedly went down.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?
They went crazy.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
You killed them.
So you killed them?
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka.
Murphy, goddamit.
I heard that.
I don't know.
Ho-ly shit.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Give up?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Are you still looking for a job?
What?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
That was great - jeez, thanks again for cooking all this.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
Seymour! Hello! What are you doing here?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
It's not optional!
Aren't there a million places like this?
Hi Josh.
Yeah, right...
You make me nervous! I always feel like you're going out of your way to make me feel uncomfortable so you can laugh at me!
Yeah, well --
Okay... I promise.
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
Hi.
Much later.
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
You can have that one.
What is this?
Hey - why do you have this?
Look, maybe that's him!
What's he doing now?
Not really...
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
What happened to Seymour?
How repulsive!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
There.
I dunno...
Do you want anything?
We're not.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
You still interested in that?
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Punk rock is over!
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
That's five hundred dollars.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Really? Can I see it?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
I - I'd really rather not...
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
What did you tell that girl?
It's not hopeless...
For nineteen years...
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Aren't you going to get that?
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
Oh, uh... they were a present from Dana.
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
...What do you mean?
What's up?
Uh... sure... come in.
What's the matter?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Please Josh?
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
No... they said she was here...
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
There is no reason for fear.
I am a man of peace.
You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
I do need to see Starling.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
What?
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
Go, now.  Such a gentleman. 
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Second death? Where?-
What a good week.
Got me out of trouble.
I don't really. But understand something- even though it may take me two or three days to sort this out-  -when I'm gone, you'll still have to build the bridge. And I don't want the men to have lost respect for you.
Have you got it?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
Good luck.
How many do you think they've killed?
Did it look like this in your mind?
He has children?
How many cattle?
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
What are you working on, Egon?
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
So what happened to Mr. Right?  I hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.
Good luck.
So this is what you do, huh?
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Or we could do that.
They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
I'm not sure this is such a good idea?  Do they know you're doing this?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
Then why have you come?
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Sherman, I've done lots of favors for you.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
Boys, listen.  You're scaring the straights. Let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
Who was that?
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
If you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  Who wants it first?  Come on, Ray.  Try me, sucker.
Something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Is the line sinking?
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
So, no goat hooves, huh?
Who?
Who?  Who?  Who?
I love this.  We're onto something really big.  I can smell it, Ray.  We're going to make some headlines with this one.
Oh good, you're here.  Spengler and I have something really amazing to show you.
This is what you do with your spare time?
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
It looks like a giant Jello mold.
Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
Roy?  Your clock broke.
Incredible!  Five for five.  You're not cheating on me here, are you?
Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
I think I should spend the night here.
Don't scream.
You're the best one in your row.
You must have gotten the last copy.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
But why?  The students love us!
That is one speedy mutt.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
I want you to have this. 
It's a souvenir from the 1964 World's Fair at Flushing Meadow.  It's my lucky coin.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
Thank you for coming so quickly.  The guests are starting to ask questions and I'm running out of excuses.
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
At ease, Officers.  I'm Peter Venkman.  I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding here and I want to cooperate in every way I can.
All right.  What is it?
Nervous?
Well, just 75 more to go.  What's this one?
Wait!  Wait!  Let me ask you something.  If you like shot Superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
Oh!  You're here.
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Did you see anything?
It's Peter, Egon.  I've got a problem.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
Yeah, yeah.  I was just thinking.  It probably wouldn't be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Who?
No!  You said crossing the beams would be BAD.  It'll kill her!  And us!
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Sorry, Buddy!
I've got to sleep.
What happened??!!!?
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Spengler and I have charted every psychic occurrence in the Tri-State area for the past two years.  The graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
I don't know.  Talk to it.
"Get her?"  That was your whole plan?  You call that science?
You'll never regret this, Ray.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Stantz?  You okay in there?
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
Where have you been?
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
I want that bastard dead!
I am their hero!
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
But they're not destroyed, not yet.
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Insubordination.  To the Emperor... and the Senate.
Gods of hell!  This must cost a fortune!  How many days is this going to go on?
So am I.
We must obey our emperor and the Senate.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
Why isn't he dead?  Damn you, you promised me he would be dead!
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
Where are they?
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
As soon as I can.
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
This is our oil from our estates?
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
Condemned?  Aren't I owed a trial before being condemned?
Take your hands off me animal!
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
At the end of the day I was approached by the Golden Pompeii Olive Oil company.  Small, but profitable.  They asked if you would endorse their oil.  We could get some very nice posters.  Make some very big money...
Could you do it?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Where we going?
Was she married or something?
All right.
Yes.
But you're not enrolled.
What?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Why?
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
The marble?
I just don't think it would work.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
The day after tomorrow?
657-2036
Ben!
Yes, I will.
What are you then?
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Where are you?
Give me an hour.
Can I help you, sir!
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Where is your luggage?
You don't?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What do you think?
Her portrait?
I think I'll go to bed.
But they would! Don't you see?
I want to say something first.
May I sit down?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Do you want me to get it?
To tell you?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Yes?
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Do you want to hear it or not?
We're talking.
How many times a year.
Man, is this interesting.
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
And you were a student also.
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
No.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Good.
Good.
I have my reasons.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
What are you doing?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
How?
What have you done to her?
I say I've got it.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I drive around.
Why did you say that?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
When did you two talk this over?
I guess -- about my future.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
What?
What?
Hello.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Now look -- please --
But why?
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Hello.
Can you see me now?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Is anything wrong?
Turn 'em up.
It's a short life and a gay one...
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
How?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I don't like your tone.
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
I've quit.
I have an idea working in my head... 
He must be very nice.
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That? 
Oh!
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Poor child --  I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
We'll dance.
I'll do anything for you.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
Strange man...
Go away. Who are you --?
I want to be alone --
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
What can you see?
No.
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
Really?
I'll not denounce you.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
Very early in the morning.
On the train?
The Baron is tired?
Is that too much, Baron?
That was my last.
I take five hundred.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
The war.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
Hello! Hello! --
For me?
And the child isn't coming?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Anyone asked for me?
Any letters?
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang... 
Oh!
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
Oh, I've got to find it.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
A man might what?
You dance splendidly.
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
Yes, of course, -- money!
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Moreover --
Moreover...
Miss Flaemm.
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
Baron!
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
What?
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep. 
Madam will dress now, it is late.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
It is time for the performance.
He will be on the train.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
You're discharged.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
Just one moment, sir.
The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
We will wait.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Hi, Bobo.
I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
No.
Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It's in the envelope by the door.
Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
Not much time.
Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. He's had an internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding to death inside.
Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
All right.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
They knocked out my tooth!
Don't mention it.
I like those.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Up to you.
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
I tripped over a chair.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
Going somewhere?
No.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
There's nothing more to talk about.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
Where's the five?
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
Get well soon.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
No.
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
Think about it. Okay?
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
Don't I get any say in this?
That's what I say.
Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
Yes, I know, I know.
Ate the gun. Oh.
That's that, then.
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
I can be real stiff.
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
Detective Carter from the Haddonfield P.D.
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Bruce... what's going on?  The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
No.  Wait for the police.
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
He found you, didn't he?
I'm not leaving without her.
Yeah, me too, Keri.
Swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
Not me.
What are you doing here?!
I can see that.  Why?
You really think Eddie killed her?
You look kind of cold.
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
It's John, isn't it?
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
The serial killer?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Keri, you all right?
Wait.
You aced it, didn't you?
Mom -- Who is this?
Is Tim there?
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Mommy!!!
What is it this time?
What should I do?
God ... this can't be true.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in Northern Europe thousands of years ago.  They were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  Of all the runes, Thorn had the most negative influence. Cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
Where's the child?
Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
Miss me, baby?
We've never met.
I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
Home, sweet home.
Um.
How everybody says "fuck" and "shit" all the time.  I used to be scared shitless I'd say "fuck" or "shit" in public, by accident.  Now everybody says "fuck" and "shit," "fuck" and "shit" all the time. Something very big must have happened while we were out of the country.
At least we found the diamonds.
Thank God we found the fucking diamonds!
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
What'll you do for transportation?
And how were things?
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
Huh.
When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Insurance!
Fifty years?
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
Gee whiz--
You--you aren't going to have any friends left, if you don't watch out.
You were about to ask a question?
Ask it!
And you've been roaming the streets while your mother is God-knows-where?
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise.
"Dad?"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there.
She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
I'm a man.
No.
That's a rifle you have?
That's a cartridge, if I'm not mistaken.  Gunpowder, bullet, cartridge case, and fulminate of mercury percussion cap--all set to go. PAUL I was cleaning it.
Get mad!  Tell me you don't like the way I treat your mother!  Tell me you wish I'd never come home!
I don't know what I hope.  But I don't think you care what I hope, anyway.  You don't know me.  You don't know her, either.  I don't think you know anybody.  You talk to everybody just the same.
"Hamburger Heaven."
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
I'm engaged.
You don't even know me.
How do you do?
Like hugging a lamp post.
Bluh.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
People now have dignity when frying eggs?
What then?
It couldn't!
Such as?...
The doctor.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
Did you like it, dear?
He cried.
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
He's a child!
No you don't.
Honor, I suppose.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Just her neighbor and doctor? That's all?
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
None.
You've been bitten by bats?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
This is man to man.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
You're a filthy, rotten bastard.
You hope.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
Don Quixote.
Here.  Finish the job.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
Don't shoot.
Can't do it.
New lives begin!
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
And you went home unannounced, too?
Alice is dead?
I'm only ten years old.
Because he was cruel?
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Kid--kid--
Thank God!
A what kind of doctor?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
Yes, he is.
What's his name?
What are his symptoms?
We don't have a maid any more.
I keep having this nightmare--that he catches us.
He'd assume we had.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
Coming.
What then?
The park!
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
I am Dr. Norbert Woodly--a physician, a healer.  I find it disgusting and frightening that a killer should be a respected member of society.  Gentleness must replace violence everywhere, or we are doomed.
We made the date three months ago.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
The what?
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
That's been said before.
You know each other?
Is that a fact?
You've got to fight from time to time.
The late Mrs. Harold Ryan.
You ever hear the story about the boy who carried a calf around the barn every day?
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
Minors aren't allowed at fights.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Now, what do you want?
Just one.
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Are you sure it's all right?
Joanne?
No. I saw her with Tod.
Where's he?
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
No.
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
How important do you think sex is?
What's T-J?
What the crap?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
She left you right?
What happened?
Andy.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
They're legal now.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you belong.
What are you doing here?
Do the police want to arrest me?
Where'd you hear that name?
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
Is Marsha there?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Oh yeah? I've done a lot of good stuff. Shorts, features. No major roles it's true. But good stuff.
God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
What you got in mind?
You're talking about real excitement?
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
Where's Ratan?
That film was a fake! Everything's phony...
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
But I...
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
What does that do?
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
Was he with a girl?
I think I should mention, Candy, that Harold does have his eccentric moments.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Yes.
Isn't this your vehicle?
Your tree.
Haven't we met before?
What do you see?
Do you sing and dance?
But this is my car.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
Sort of.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Me! No. Of course not.
What do you think?
You don't look eighty.
That's a nice teapot.
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
What were you fighting for?
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
But they'll put me in jail.
Just like this.
That wasn't very scary.
... which I hope will make you very happy.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
I feel giddy.
Mother.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
Fifteen.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Harold?
You liked your teachers?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
How about to slit his throat?
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Parasite!
It's different for us.
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.
I want to go back!
I... I had a visitor.
What?
What do you mean?
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Well... G'bye.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
Steve...
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
I thought Steve had talked to you?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
I need to touch it to "see"...
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
I worry about you.
It's her choice --  She's human --
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
Oh, Jesus!! Hellboy -- ?? Is real --
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
What are you trying to say?
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
-- should go back. Now!
Myers??? How's your arm?
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
Myers?
You want me to hold him down?
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?
Anything else you --
You better have that looked at.
Hi.
He -- loves you.
But it's not true, is it?
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.
Christ!
It's my lucky day.
Lucky man.
The box... you opened it. We came.
This isn't for real.
No time for argument.
Many times.
We want the man who did this --
No.
There is going to BE a wedding?
But you said --
Don't look at me.
...somebody...
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
This is what began it.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
Sure.
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
He's here?
You're NOT going to faint.
It's probably going to need stitches.
Take it slowly.
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
Is this upsetting you?
Drinking alone.
I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
First time for everything.
You know, you're very beautiful.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
Well I want you to see the house.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
Are you O.K.?
What are you drinking, love?
I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.
PLEASE. You're in danger.
I won't be able to stand.
I'm here.
What's wrong?
Alison's.
You gotta be kidding me.
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Nice, Barry.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
What did he ever do to you?
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Un-fucking-believable.  Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
None.  Christ!
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
That is perverse.  Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde.  What about Television?
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
That's what I said.
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
He's got one!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Anna.
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
What are you talking about?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Huh?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
I always hated this song.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
What needs sorting out?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
Hi.
Are you coming home?
So you weren't interested in music at all?
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
What were the others?
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
It sounds stupid.
I don't know.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
Hello.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
Hello.
Do you want me to be there?
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
You're soaking.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
C'mon.  I want to know.
You know the difference.
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Nothing.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
What are you going to talk to me about?
No.  Probably not.
So?
About what?
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
So you live in Chicago now?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
The Conformist.
Are you okay?
Great.  Super-fantastic.
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
He'd want to know about all this.
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.
You're very macabre.
No.
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Who is he?
I'm a witness to a murder.  That seems to put me pretty high on your friend's chop list.
No.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
You're wrong.
Is this what you killed them with?
You did kill those men.
The estate stuff is pretty straight forward.  Just lots of forms and an appearance at the county seat.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?
And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
Yes.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Forget it.
All fashionably without heads.
I want Taupin.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Stop.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Does it change with me in the room?
He told me there could be only one.
I don't understand.
What is to become of me?  Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
Go ahead, Senor.  I have my friend to keep me company.
My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
Something pretty.
No doubt.
Finish your prayers?
We must talk.
Aye.  It is his duty.  All of ours.
My father taught me.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
The last four.
_Answer_ me.
He found us even there.
You've been here from the start.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
We have some unfinished business.
I want you to come to me.
Yes laddie, I have her.
My condolences.
Ah Steven, it is good to see you.
Steven, Conor didn't die.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
But --
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
All right, dear.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Did you give her the money?
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
How long would the interview take?
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Call Duffy!
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
What do you want?
Hello, Hildy!
How long is what?
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Sure you can. Come on.
What do you mean by that?
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to.  How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
You've got to help me, Hildy.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
Bermuda.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Thanks...
Afraid? I should say not!
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
What tricks would I pull?
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
All the words you've got.
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Double-crossing swine!
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
Look at me, Hildy --
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Flip a coin.
Hildy!
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
It'll be Heaven!
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Anything you want, Boss.
Walter!
There's money in it, Cooley.
How much?
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
She looks as though she's going to come to.
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
We know what you're up to.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
Where is he?
Just one second --
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
You'll take fifty and like it!
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Mother!
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
What good'll it do?
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
What's from the Governor?
The City Sealer's office!
Get out of here!
Here's the picture of my wife.
Look out!
Get the cops, somebody.
Williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
Give him the you-know-what.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
I suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. Got it? Like this.
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
And Jim.
Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
You're a mug, Clive. We did our bit in the Last Lot.
How's your war, Mac?
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
No Turks.
We don't know anything about it
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
You know it? It must be an old one.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
What did he say?
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
It was the best time of his life.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
What did I do to deserve this?
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
Cone.
I agree.
What about the tree?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around... wait here.
What the hell are you laughing about?
You mean John Wayne?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
She's pretty cute.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Yeah.
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
I hope you fixed the spare like I asked ya.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
Don't look back, just get in the car.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Go around him.
Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
What?
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
Tiny ain't got no car, he ain't even got a bicycle.
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Ugh, what's that smell?
Fuck, it's freezing.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Really, now is not the time to make waves.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Rise and shine.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
A couple hours!
Recover any bodies?
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Open up the trunk.
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
I've been meaning to ask you, Mrs... Ummmm.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
This is way too fucked up for words.
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Local girl, Karen Murphy, been missing for a couple months, figured for a runaway.
Shit, don't these packrat hillbillies throw anything away?
We gotta break it open.
Tell it to my daughter.
Boss, the way I see it is these kids probally stop off somewhere, bought a bunch of booze and are off getting shitfaced.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
You sure this guy's supposed to ride with us? Seems kind of weird.
Wydell.
Over.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet?
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Oui.
Shall we close up, then?
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
My little French.
Yeah? What?
Please. Just one minute of your time.
Well?
Anyway. Come already to the point.
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Lila?
A little resistance would be nice, damn it.
Nice night.
Progress!
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever.
My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
As do I.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans.
You really enjoy my company?
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
Shaving cream?
Oh, and the sun block?
Flares?
We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, Sunny."  Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
It's perfect!
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
Who is it?
Who from work?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Really?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Thanks to you, Nate.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
Pittsburgh?
Give me a bottle of beer.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
And a fact is a fact.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
Are you ready for another?
How much?
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Will you take a check, Bert?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
That's your problem.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
I never saw you do anything else.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Thinking about what?
So does Eddie.
How do we stand?
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
I can beat him.
I'll beat him the next game.
Half.
Fifty per cent?
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Whaddya mean?
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
Quit. He's too good.
How much we got?
Is this all we got left?
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
When?
I thought we came here to play pool.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
How much are you ahead?
You better not miss, friend.
How long have you been waiting?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Have a nice trip?
Hey!
Why did you do that?
What time is it?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
You got it all in your head?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
No, why should I? It's yours.
What are you writing?
Who is it?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
Well, what's so funny?
What do you want to tell me?
A week? A year?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Oh, grow up.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Is that a fact?
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Do you remember where you lived?
Yes.
Do you remember where it is?
Will you keep feeding me?  How long can you live like that?  Until it kills you?  Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
You want me to stay?
Do you still want me to stay?
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
You and that damned garden.
The more we plant, the more that'll grow, and the happier --
Only got one kind.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
There are more this year than last.
... and Rigel.
Is that all he said?
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
We were having a little talk.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
This is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
I swear it was here.
Damn.
What is it?
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.
When?
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
What do you want me to do?
You still believe in him.
Better be. You left me for him.
Are you all right?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
I've got a lock on the signal pattern. We can filter it out.
Not really...
You have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
You punched the President in the face?
Pops, you're a genius!
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
Must be thousands of them. What are they doing?
Is my wife in the air?
Where are they?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
How do you know?
Be careful.
Really? You don't mind?
Dick-weed.
I shouldn't have left her.
Damn it!
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
I couldn't find anything. Everyone is packing up, they're leaving. Word is a space ship is heading this way.
How' he doing?
I'm not leaving.
Why did you people come here?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
May we go home now, please?
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
All my life!
Dad?
Ah, Venice...
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
How's the head?
Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
Henry, the pen --
Look what you did!
The Word of God...
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-Twelfth Century, I should think.
Where did this come from?
Let me tell you another "bedtime story," Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
You could be more right than you know.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
DONOVAN!
It must be one of these...
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
Knock it off. You're not mad.
What do you know about this place?
All I have to do is squeeze.
Dad!
It is you Junior!
But what are you doing here?
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Well, what was left of him.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
If only I could have been with you.
Rats?
You did!!
No! Don't Shoot!
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
I ought to tell you something.
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
What does that mean?
Dad, are we hit?!
Nice landing.
Those people are trying to kill us!
It's a new experience for me.
Dad?!
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
I like Indiana.
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
You're strangely dressed... for a knight.
Get that camel out of the way!
I don't need camels.
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
Where's my father?
Where is he? Talk -- or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
Who are you?
And why were you trying to kill me?
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
What?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
He's not exactly what we call "a spring chicken".
You understand what he tells us?
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
What's that?
Indy?
What does it mean, Indy?
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
Let up on the brake!
Give me the stones!
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
But why would the Maharajah take this sacred stone?
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
You don't look very good.
God, I am starving, but I can't eat this...
A what...?
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
What about the future?
I'd like to find one of those myself.
He's afraid of something.
I've always had a weakness for folk dancing.
Cheer up, you lost your prince, but dinner's on the way.
What?!
WILLIE?!
GET US OUT! Willie, shut up and listen! There's got to be a fulcrum release! Look around!
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
What're we going to do?!
Let her go! Our only chance is outrunning them!
I get it!
My name is AL.
Al.
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Do me a favor, Al.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
I know...it sounds insane.
You're not crazy.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
You'll be alive.
What do I do?
Get your breathing down. You sound like a cement mixer.
Did you hear that?
JOE Or what?
I did. I brought you back here.
Sue them.
Door's locked.
Corridor A.
Like the guys that attacked us.
Black suits and helmets.
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
Don't talk, I told you. You just screwed it up.
What is it?
What do we do?
You mean...just leave.
What about money?
It's illegal.
Swim.
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
Here...all the seaweed you want. Now, what?
It's sand.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
She's...pretty fast.
.
Wait.
What happened?
Yeah. I did it.
Not that tie with that coat.
Even Rene?
What is it, your charm?
You're doing great with her.
It's embarrassing.
Some agent you are.
Osaka.
Come on, she's getting away.
Sapporo..
Where are you going?
Relax. Make your mind a blank.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
Don't touch a thing.
...drink it.
It's him.
Are you alright?
He aready made the deal..
There's a lot you don't know.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Be quiet.
Never mind that, where are we now.
I have been... I think you're right.
You were the one who was always suspicious of her!
She is beautiful.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
You're a lucky man.
Awwww...
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
You just got a Mickey.
Not that truth!
No!
I didn't do anything.
Nice?
I knew you were trouble.
Sir?
That crazy guy?
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
Now remember, your short term memory may have been affected.
Your memory.
Anything....You call us right away. You got that?
Right.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Well...
We're here.
Ahhh...nothing.
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
Don't do it!
How's that for fucking Savoir Fair!
About cholesterol...You know what I know, you'd have the seafood.
The fresh tuna?..
The poet...something he said...
What's so funny?
Wait. What's your name?
You mean from it.
You again.
And how'm I doing?
Trans Ocean Travel.
He likes the quiet. They were here last week.
Why did you stay with me?
Who else is interested in me?
You work for Ryuji?
Were you working for him last night?
You're leaving.
We're very close.
You don't believe me.
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
Where what?
Wait a minute! How'd you know Dieter was coming here?
I know the territory.
So do I.
Why not?
What?
Uh...wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you
It wasn't me. It was him.
Come on.
What could you find in this place?
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
This the only spare?
Ow?...
It will.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?
It'l take months.
Yeah? What for?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
Mom.
Three hours.
Are you all right?
What does that do?
I can't get out of here til mid- morning. I'll be in tomorrow night...  Listen, could you call a number for me, it's in Mississippi...
Can I go to dance tomorrow? I'm better...
Do you want more rice?
Yeah, I heard rumors.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
That bullet was for a .38 caliber. Do you own a .38?
That computer has everything...
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Yeah?
I can take her.
Right now?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I don't understand.
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
"I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Yeah, I'm here.
I discovered this. SEC filing...  For the sale of the CBS Corporation to Westinghouse Corporation.
Lowell.
Lowell!
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Mike... in my...
Did work.
How much would I get paid?
Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
You know, I was thinking of calling you tomorrow, anyway.  How are your kids handling the new house?
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Liane, this is a preliminary...  You didn't tell her we were taping? What did she think she was coming to New York for?
Lowell, I can't afford --
I called Richard Scruggs in Mississippi...
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
No? No, what?
That's not the point.
You manipulated me into this...!
What's happening?!
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
What do you mean there is no family?
All of us did. There was this whole line of people... whole line of CEOs up there all swearing.
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
And, he gets out there and he has five strokes on us. He has more concentration than anybody I've ever met. It's spooky how he can concentrate.
You threatening my family, now, too?
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
No!
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
You're in a rush.
That's his lawyer.
Lemme tell you something. You are the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
Objection, your honor!
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
He's the wrong man.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
These are yours.
I assume this is on Rex?
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
To victory.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
Hello?
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Hmmm...
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
We're damaged goods.
Friends?
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Honey, I could sit...
Comfy!
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Sweet.
We are. And it's winding down.
I was devastated. Of course.
Is this a lover?
Maybe.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
Every week --
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
Is this Ming?
Mr. Massey --
Ha Ha.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
...arty farty!
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
What's Kirshner?
Berry spoons.
Extinguish?
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
OhMary
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and methose things give me a stiff pain.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
We'll go into that some other time.
What's this about not eating?
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Where are you taking me?
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to
Fine man to fall in love with.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
Peter Warne! 
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
What would you like to have me do?
We've done that already.
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it. 
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
Whadda you want!
Oh, yeah?
I beg your pardon!
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Hey, Brat!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Do you mind putting out the light?
You've got a name, haven't you?
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Here
High time you got back.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Thanks, professor.
Detectives!
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
Not a one.
But what!
What are you thinking about?
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're brokeand hungryand everything looks black. It's a long movement like this  with a follow through.
Here comes a car!
You! Don't make me laugh.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
What'd you give him for the car?
Any luck?
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Better go back to your bed.
I hope you got your money.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited
I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish.  If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed  Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tiredand it's the only thing around.
Whatever you say, darling.
Where's the bus to New York?
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that busI told them to wait!
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
The old man's screwy!
I said, the old man's screwy!
Collect?
Joe, listen
What!
You're drunk.
If it's on the level.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Funny couple, ain't they?
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
What do you reckon that's for?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Yeah. They're all upright till they walk out on you.
What's up?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Do you pack a gat?[11] A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
You love them, don't you?
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
If this is Oswald, it must be our third Oswald.
The U.S. Attorney in Washington "declines" to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles, Charles Cabell, CIA Director Richard Helms, or any FBI agent we named.
And Oswald?
Recall any names?
Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
Did he pay you for this?
Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking tour?
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
He had his palm print on the weapon.
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
What's it look like, Nick?
Can you ascertain if there's Proloid in his system?
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
It leads farther than that.
The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
...give me protection?
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
Then who killed the President?
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
Daddy said it was all right if I was real quiet.
Dad, look what I drew.
Are we going away, Daddy?
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
He kept trying to get me to change my story about the shots.  He was getting hot under the collar, and telling the woman not to write when he wanted.
I want the truth.
These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
Who?
Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy, that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfer of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities.  It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Because when I scheduled it I didn't realize it was a holiday.  You were there, why didn't you say something?
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
Did they live?
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Of course, I've changed!  My eyes have opened, and once they're open, believe me, what used to look normal seems insane!  And now King.  Don't you think this has something to do with that?  Can't you see?
Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do.
I know David - a strange character.
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
Goddamn Sam!
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Time?
The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other, and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to recycle this thing.  The other problem is there was a tree right there...  Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film.
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
It never did. 
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Where is Banister in all this?
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
That's all you've had all this time?
Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
Then do you understand that I cannot tell the truth here?  In Dallas. That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?
But if I am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing.  Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and I know I won't live to see you another time.  My life is in danger here. Do I sound screwy?
This looks pretty good on me.
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
But then you told her you were home.
You were there for me.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
What?
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
How'd you know where he was?
What's going on?
She sound scared?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
I'm not a loser.
Help yourself.
My pocketbook.
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with all the cash, I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic.
How was your flight?
I don't think so.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
Is it dark?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
What did they want to know?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
You get a chance to use it?
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Somebody loan it to you?
You never got into the whole CD revolution?
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
Fifteen thousand.
I walked right past you.
Catching a movie.
And Annette's it for you?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
Why?
What're you, a bag lady?
You don't actually do it that way?
You think he's got a thing for you?
You do that?
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison...
Then you're out and you get nothing.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I thought you were tired of your business?
Yes'm.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
You know what we want.
I'm recording this.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
There was a guy with Melanie?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
I'm waiting for the phone.
What were you two fighting about?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
Well, then, why don't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
Baby, I ain't come here -- She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.
I understand woman, damn!
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
You told em? You told em it's me?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
What the fuck's that got to do with it?
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
Can you cover that?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
So you come out with her Robinson's/May bag, go meet Sheronda. Simone peeks out, waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody's watchin'. She leaves the store, gets in her car -- mission accomplished.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
How long?
Is it ready to go?
So where did you go?
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Is it dead?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
Please.
Lemme have the bag.
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
I got me five M-60 machine guns. These came straight from the Gulf War. I sold me three of them so far, twenty grand a piece.
I'm going to wait in the car.
You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Who was Beaumont?
What did he do?
Can I ask you about Melanie?
What's your relationship?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
If there were nothin; in here but towels, maybe she didn't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F. got it. But, she put these fuckin' books in here to trick our ass.
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
I'm going out for a few hours.
They don't have your winning personality.
How can I help you?
Ten thousand sounds high.
What's his full name?
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
I need your name and address.
It still sounds high.
Somebody already did.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
I got it. I just don't got it on me.
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Where is it?
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
You still there?
In a way, yes.
She's all alone.
Turn left.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
You sure?
It's all been a dream.
You want to see me? Well, here I am.
What do you want?
Well, how do I look?
What do you mean?
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
I'm too messed up to teach.
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.
He say what they looked like?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.
I had this weird flash just then.
Ah!
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
It's not healthy with it closed.
She was good in bed, though.
What do you think?
The room!
What happened to you?
You up?
Who? Jed?
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
I must have been out of my head.
What's in here?
Look at these, will ya? I don't believe it. Jesus, these are fantastic. Look, here's my Dad ... And here's my brother, when we were down in Florida.
Jake!
What's it say? A hundred and two?
How high is that?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.
I can't do it.
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
Remember that.
How come? The army?
While you were in the shower.
He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
He said you didn't have one.
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
Please.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Oh God!
Goddamn you!
WHO ARE YOU?
So first I'm arrested, right? Best LSD I ever made, right down the drain. I figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I'm lucky. That was '68.
Next thing I know I'm on Rikers Island. Ever been there?  Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. Four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. They tell me if I'll come to Vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. Well, I'd only been in jail for thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam couldn't be any worse.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
I came up with the formula back in Nam but I never got a chance to use it.
Mike, it was real. It was glorious.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
You got a nice tan, though.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
Lennox Hospital.
I'm sorry.
Still married, Jake?
I'm not sure where I can talk anymore.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
I have some ice from the machine.
I don't blame him. What should I do with the ice?
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
What's that?
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Can't shut em' down from here.
Nice touch.
Better let me.
Kay-Em!
Done!
Earth II.
Jesus what the hell is that?
Wait a minute...I need...
Sergeant!
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Jesus, God!
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
Outta here?
We're screwed!
What's this?
Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going.
You wanna release your air tanks?
Rizzo, you okay?
Rizzo, pull away!
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Kaboom.
I...I don't know what I did...
Now that's just gross.
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.
You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
You're so bossy.
Jesus!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
I don't know...sorry?
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Kay-Em we made it!
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Leave him behind!
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Jason? He's on this ship?!
Guys, please come with me!
The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son?
Just a favor for your old man.
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not.
And incidental damages, if any...
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
It's my charter. My party.
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it.
What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
He's comin' up -- !
You're very tight, y'know?  Right there.
It's three feet deep, Martin
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Now tell me something I don't know.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
Who's that young man?
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
She's right.
He lost it on the way up.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.  Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.  -- Did you go out in a boat and look around?
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
...Nothing.
What happened?
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply...
I hope we get some more help.
Think she might've run out on you?
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it?
Whose idea was it?
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
What's up?
Really? What are they like?
Jesus, Bleek.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
You're being really immature.
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
I still have your virginity!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
You know it's okay.
Can we make out now?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
Nails? Really?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
I rock a Harmony.
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Yeah.
Your guitar is named Kimber?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
We definitely want it to have junk.
What is it?
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Hello?
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
What?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
This...  ...this is what my life has become. Stuff in boxes. Stuff underground. Is that so appealing to you?
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
Can I take your coats?
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Yeah, she does.
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
Aha! You love him.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
What do you make with that?
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
You guys are playing music?
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
She answered our prayers.
We're actually, finally doing this?
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
Is it hard to learn?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
What if they're dangerous?
You gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
This guy killed a mess of people.
Henry Lucas.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Sure.
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
...Well I probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
...Well then, that's how many I killed.
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.
So how's it going?
I like that.
Carrie.
All set?
Stop being so fucking melodramatic! If it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
There's more...
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Carrie, watch for Early.
Bri'.
With how many people?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
You know what else?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
I'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
Probably.
Telly.
Did she suck your dick?
Why?
It's no big deal, right?
You thirsty?
You know like in "The Wonder Twins" they share everything.
Man, this guy is really good.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
So really, it's good luck.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
How much you gonna take?
About ten. Fifteen is good.
Yo, you got any weed around here?
Hurry up man. Let's be out. I wanna go swimmin'.
Where you goin' tonight?
No I'm serious. Can I suck your tit? Either of you guys. I don't care.
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
Yeah. Come on.
You know I've been thinking about you lately.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
Do you like kissing me?
I'm nervous.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Dance!
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
Like where are your erogenous zones?
I hate sucking dick!
Wish me luck.
What happened?
Do you know where he went?
Yep.
Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
Yep.
Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
No. I was just kidding.
Hello?
Hello?
Where does everyone sleep?
Yeah.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
It was... it was.
What's that supposed to mean?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Are you crazy?
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
You got it on the board.
Then let's narrow it down.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
What are you talking about?
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
I spoke to Jeremy.  He's watching Sanderson's kid.  Sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
What do you mean, stand out?
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Hello, Peter.
And -- what path is that?
Why did you write remember on the wall?
I'm just trying to play the game.
What?
Please... wait.
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Now what?
There's three.  The first is 1983. Lionel Baines.  The Boston...
Feeling better?
You must be Erica.
Has he gotten through to any?
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
You mean, no prints but hers?
Well?
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
As large as castles.
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
If you can think of anything else give us a call.
Excuse me... you said earlier that Mary Albert just moved in.  How long ago was that?
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
Where were you last night?
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
Peter...
You're always in the middle of a match.
You have something you want to say?
Yes, Doctor Sheppard.  We called you back but you weren't home.  We have the book.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
Well, I think I've had enough.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
Do you?
You have to win every point, don't you?
Of course.
I know it was bad.
I know you didn't
Alright.  What about me?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
Did you call?
He's replaying the game I played against him move by move, using these girls as the Chess pieces.  All the girls have been found in their homes except Christie Eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  Why?
The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
Peter...
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
Then help me to understand.  I want to understand.
Of course it isn't.  It's always difficult when someone you love dies. But you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
Take the western passage.
That's a better one.
The White Castle has fallen.
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
You have not slept in two days.
They know when they're going to die?
I can't reach her.
Can she be forced?
From here, I must go alone.
The spiral begins in the west.
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
Do not let the waters touch you.
It is today?
Try your tricks on me and I'll turn myself back into a snake and bite you.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
Well, I'm not impressed.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
What is that awful looking place?
A venison pie as big as a house.
My heart stays here.
Bread is for peasants, and wine makes me sneeze. Got any gumdrops?
I'm hungry.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
And do you think I live on air?
Food for crows.
I am being exploited! Where are you going?
Passable, pimple, very passable.
He will come for me.
What news from our friends?
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
I will tell you something you did not know, Turold. Had it been my choice, all those years ago, I would have chosen you for my king. But my parents chose otherwise.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
We seek the Fortress of Krull.
It is the time.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
Kegan!
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
She was not as beautiful.
You see?
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Knowledge.
Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
...Good...  But what's special in him?
Why can't I have a bank account?
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
When I say I love you.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
Where are you going?
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
It's too big.
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
I'm here, I'll never leave you again, Mathilda, never. I swear.
Poor darling, and then?
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
No! I don't want to leave you!!
You say it just to calm me!
Yes?
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
...OK... Good.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
Here comes the resume.
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
It's impossible.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
What would you like us to do?
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
So what's the deal Maurice?
Yes -- you are.
I've seen it before.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Yes?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
What it is -- is the truth.
I want to be shown...  Maurice would you do anything for me?
Anything?
A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
There's no reason.
Walk with me?
I want children.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
I don't know.
I know where my heaven is.
The beach of Pacifica, California.
What's his story?
Hansen's whipped.  Has to call his wife every two hours or she'll go ballistic when he gets home.
I'm going to drop off Tandy at the station and then drop you back.
I thought you were asleep.
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
It has to be a full character's name.
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
You going on a trip Mr. Parker?
I'm walking there Kris.
The hairs on my arm are standing up... Something strange is happening.
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
Are they standing?
Come on Mr. Parker.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
You're in pain.
... My father.
Where did he go?
What's your shoe size?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Coffee?
Sparkling apple cider?
One drink minimum per show. Everything's ten dollars. Now... tell me what you want or I'll eighty- six you.
Are you working?
Sarah -- with an H?
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
What's up?
Yes.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Yes.
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
How long have I been here?
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Please!
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Will you lighten up, please?
There are limits.
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
How'd this happen?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
A full night on the street and this is all?
But it's a top three school --
You understand you're on trial for murder?
I loved him!
Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
It's so shameful...
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
Dewey Newcomb?
All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
So everything you just said --
You're not going up there.
What's going on?
Why didn't you call me?
You can't even imagine.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
Is she?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Uh -- family.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
You're pawning The Rock?!
Oh, how sweet! You made friends with a nerdy girl.
Good luck.
Aside from that.
Why?
You're kind of being a butt-head right now.
How can you still believe she's innocent?
The what?
Whoa -- Why?
Someone missed you.
But I'm not positive it's gonna happen tonight --
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
What?
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Amazing how?
His twenty-seven year old daughter and the pool boy.
And I fully support that.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Thanks for the backup.
Oh, God. What if Josh doesn't think I'm serious enough?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
There he is!
Fire moat... why do that?
More fun win battle?
My generosity is not so large as that.
You... you're a beast!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Damn you!
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
No more... please...
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
Might we watch, too?
You come stealee tleasoo?
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
I meant no disrespect.
You be our guest, Jack.
Don't you know?
Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
What do I do?
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
By the grace of God.
Shhhh!
Pregnant, is she?
Damn them!
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
And this?  Some of their handiwork?
Make haste!  We've a hard day's march ahead.
God's blessing.
What make ye of that, Jack?
Is she... dead?
Wait, Jack.
Can we trust him?
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Easily spoken...
There aren't enough arrows.
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
I was with the Princess.
You see!  You see!
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
What shall we do?
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
How much longer?
Jack!
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Its powers are strong.
I'm afraid it may storm.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Sunlight?
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Honored to make your acquaintance.
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
No!
I don't believe you.
This is sad news, be it true.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'd be honored.
How so?
What do we do now?
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
The Avatar.  I like the sound of it.
Uhm... fine work.
Simple as that, eh?
Plenty treasure inside... Jimmy seen it once.
Marco!
Dad's disappeared!
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
Red.
I put him to work.
I couldn't get it to go down.
I'm living here while I build another house.
My keys.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
You have to ask like that?
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
Not really.
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
Where are you?!
Why is that?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Mr. Stevens.  One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
I have the permit.
What are you talking about?  You love your job.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
Well, I feel better about this now.
I've got one favor to ask.
Is Alyssa home?
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
Thanks for the shower.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
This has got to stop!
You'll have to explain that to the police.
I forgot where I put my keys.
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
I hate turkey.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Where is it?
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
You're too fucking late.
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
Sun glasses?
I would have killed him.
After everything.
She seemed upset.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
And you told Mom today?
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
Can you build a house in four months?
No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
It's my day off.  I thought I'd help with the plumbing.
Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
How many bedrooms will your house have?
Because Dad left?
He never answers.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
When's school over?
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
With your hands or your tongue?
Do you need help?
It's been a while.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
I thought we were helping.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
Is your back still killing you?
Peter left me yesterday.
Nothing.
We've eaten.
After the kids are back in school.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
Despite you.
Where are the kids?
Hey.
I've missed you guys.
What are you doing in my room?
There were no PG's.  So I just gave them money to play games.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
We get the games on the radio sometimes.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Yeah.
She's alright, isn't she?
Why not?
She always said that if you were on the outside...
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
Comfortable?
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Claude. That's my name. Claude. That's never happened before.
Don't I know you?
Here, this belongs to you.  It was empty when I found it.
Where they taking us, anyway?
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
What are they gonna do to us?
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
What I know about boats is they take you to freedom. Come on, man. I think we can do this.
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
No.
What'd you say?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
You get ketchup?
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
God may have given it, but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it.
Crawfords.
It's a pardon from the governor.
He said they keep it parked out behind the barn. Can't be that hard to fly a plane. Lots of people do it.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
You're a sucker. I'd have taken that deal.
Damn, it was getting hot in there.
I don't like it, I don't like it one bit. We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity. We'd be half way to New York by now.
What'd you say?
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time.
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
Soft and supple. Like a lady's.
At least he didn't kill Santa Claus with his bare hands.
We don't need no fences at Camp 8, boss.
Where am I at, man?
Hell of a way to get out. Heard they burned up in that fire yesterday.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
That musta messed 'em up pretty bad.
I can't take that, mama.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Lemonade?
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Apparently, your sister died.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Of course I can. Drink or she dies.  Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Welcome to the party. It's so nice to see all of you here.
Now will you get in the flask?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Try an angel.
How come you're not older?
Did you just talk?
They castrated him. He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
I didn't murder anybody
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Thanks.
You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
Boogerland!
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
You sure you're down with this?
This don't look good.
So I followed him...
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Hello.
Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window over.
The South.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
Valerie?
I think I'm floating.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
We're going to Jersey?
Do me.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
That's better.  How do you want us?
How do you want us?
It's a real privilege, Sandman.
Do you have anything special in mind?
You missed something special.
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.
What's going on, Logan?!
It's him! The first Sandman. He killed... Doc.
Yes... probably he was renewed?
But you put yourself on the circuit!
And?
You could have called me yourself.
Of course.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Where did you get that?
Please? What friends?
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
If you trusted me, you'd know.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Logan, I don't know where Sanctuary is. But if I take you to them, they'll kill you.
I -- I can't.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
I'm afraid.
Don't!
Don't ever let go.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
Maybe we're the first ones to get through...  Maybe Sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. It couldn't be outside.
What does it mean?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
There has to be! I know it exists! It has to!!
What are we promising him? What can we possibly give him?
Do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
What people?
We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Are you ready to put him in?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
I know...  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.
I'm sorry.
Listen.
Very strange.
No.
You recognize that guy?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
Can I call you?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
You liked it.
So, should I call Andy?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Set.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
You all right?
Where's the bathroom?
Andy, who is that guy?
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
The police called us.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
That's not Fred Madison?
When he went to work, right.
Do you remember?
We know that.
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
That's it.
There's no other bedroom?
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
Who's it from?
Good book, huh?
Same one you were reading the other night?
Don't you want to watch it?
So?
We will.
What the hell is going on?!
What was that?!!!
Let's go home.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
The heart, I guess.
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
Suit yourself, champ.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
Who is this?
What's goin' on?
I missed you.
What are you guys doin'?
Last time I saw you.
Where'd you come from?
A what?
Found in Asia!
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Have I?
Certainly not.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
They were in a quandary, and
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
What are we going to do?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
You see? You get the idea? From this reservoir here I can pipe in the whole works. Oh, I'm going to get a great kick out of this. Of course it's just to keep my hand in, but with the equipment we have here, I can put a plumbing system in for the whole village down there. Can rig it up in no time.  Do you realize those poor people are still going to the well for water?
Huh?
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Look, honey. We run the pipes through here, and we connect with the main water line here.
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
Goodness, no!
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
That would suit me perfectly. I'm always broke. How did you pay for them?
I surprise you? Now that's news.
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
Please let me help you.
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
No porters here!!
Amazing, Mr. Chang. This place is amazing! And that marble quarry in the valley is simply magnificent. Oh, I've looked around. I've seen everything. Your woodworkers and your cloth-weavers - they all seem so very, very happy.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
The High Lama is the only one from whom any information can come.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
Old woman? Chang told you that, didn't he?
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
It's astonishing - and incredible, but
Sondra Bizet.
We need men like you here, to be sure that our community will continue to thrive. In return for which, Shangri-La has much to give you. You are still, by the world's standards, a youngish man. Yet in the normal course of existence, you can expect twenty or thirty years of gradually diminishing activity. Here, however, in Shangri- La, by our standards your life has just begun, and may go on and on.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
Hurray!
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Well, we haven't been murdered in our beds yet, George, have we?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
I'd go mad!
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
Where did you come from?
No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
Was this your idea?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
A man whose life was empty!
Yes.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
How about you? Do you want to go?
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
EXCUSE ME
You shot an eight year old girl.
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
They don't?
Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
You think we're nuts.
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
You do?
Grab the coffee, will ya?  I told Zed I'd give him a buzz.
Vayanse. You others, go on.
It's a bug.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
Ha ha.  No, really.
What?
Now what?
A signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. I think we'd know if held left.
Jesus...
Where's it coming?  Where's he landing?
"Perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Would you call this a code 100?
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
Once-- just once-- I thought I'd made the discovery of a lifetime...
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
And I'm arranging deportation papers.
Oh yeah?  Well if you're suddenly such a good samaritan, why didn't you file a departure report, like you're supposed to?  You know how many rules you've just broken?
Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
Did he say where?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
Found it.
I'm getting a trajectory...
As far as I can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  All he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?
Why, you might ask?  Because you're ready.  Because you've finally gone as far as you can go without it.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
He's here.
Oh, God...
The other two will die without me.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
-- but he didn't.
Just some guy... they found.
About who?
Why?
That's not much.
I'm setting up a timer.  When it goes off tomorrow, take off your bandages and get the hell out of here.  But not before then, or you'll --
Victim's a white female.
Tell me not to worry, John.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
Uh, sir...
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Okay, Jad, what's coming?
Somewhere near the capital?
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
I'm sorry Danny, but I'll have to give you the full tour later on.
The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
If it's a question of authority.
You set me up...
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
She's a precog?
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
I tell you what.  I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.
Stop --
Four.  Wow.  What a big boy.  I love you, Sean.
Come on!
It's a little late for that.
You're alive?
Sean, wait...
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
But you have to.  They said you would.
Look, believe me, I know it's hard, but you gotta do it --
Who made you do this?
Let go of the gun.
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
You don't seem all that proud.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
I believe in that system...
You said they're destroyed.
Where?
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
You have an emergency call on your private line.
Now the second image.  Watch the water.  The wind's changed.  The ripples are going the other way.
According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
Can't they shut that off?
Crime of passion.  No premeditation.  They show up late. Most of our scrambles are flash events like this one.  We rarely see anything with premeditation anymore.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
There are two others in the room besides Anderton and Crow.
I worked homicide before I went federal.  This is what we would've called an "orgy of evidence".  Do you know how many orgies I had as a homicide copy, Gordon?
That's why you asked to partner with me on this little sortie, isn't it?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
What about your meeting?
Howard --
That was our apartment.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
What was it then?
You know I need to use you.
Wally, the other two can still function, right?
Are you telling me they can't see murders anymore?
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Are you sure?
What, sir?
So, wait, you're from where?
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
Is he cute?
What's wrong, baby?
Honey?
Oh my god. What happened?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
Oh, please.
No way that cocksucker's driving you.
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Goodbye, Bobby.
Get your hands off of her.
What's your record at?
So what do we do?
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
Brooklyn.
He must have that shit troughed.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
I got a way we make everybody happy.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
Yes.
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
What's that?
Nah.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
Sorry, man, but...
Any time, bro.
So, it's not a winning record.
How am I being shitty?
I'll page you with the number.
Fuck them.
We need guns.
I like it.
Nice work.
It's ours.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?
Who you calling?
C'mon, man...
Great. On my fucking room.
Oh really. Why's that?
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
They didn't say an address?
Motherfucker...
You know this guy?
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
He woulda told us right?
Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
What the hell did you do?
You gonna shank him in the shower?
All the more reason.
Wanna bet?
Calm down.
Look. They're together. You telling me this ain't a set-up?
No. I'll wait here.
Hey, boys.
C'mon...
Yeah. I want it.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Did you see that shit? Motherfucker.  You let in fucking Screech, dude? I'm waiting and you let in Screech?
You look good, man.
How do you know it's not drugs?
You strapped?
Don't drag my ass into this --
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
And where is...?
No shit?
What do you want?
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Come, now. You just got here.
Is it nice?
You know my pager number?
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
That money is your per diem.
Yeah.
I get it.
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
Well, that's news to me. The name's Tom.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Why?
When?
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
I told you less paper, less trouble.
It hit?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
You're a damn liar.
I'll give you back the 600.
Let Billie finish.
Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
Who the hell are you?
Man, what do you want?
What did you give it to me for then?
Putting all that poison in your hair.
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
What for?
Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig half the words.
Where am I gonna start?
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
The body is a holy repository.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
I think so. Can you catch a plane?
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
I don't want to bring my troubles home. You know that.
Talk about what?
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
If you want to tell me.
"His greatest greatness."
'Bout every other night, Red.
She know?
I better not come in.
I mean it's late, baby.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
Did you hear me?!
How many you turning out?
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
You had the number.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
That's a fine chick.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna be Bogart sometimes.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
You want to be the head man?
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
[Why?]
I need the name and address of the owner of a Toyota Corolla, license number ME31704... We didn't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches.
Deal.
[Daniel.]
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[How does it work?]
[The number you use at the bank machine.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[The Ramos kidnapping. How did it work?]
[He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[How much do you want?]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
[Maybe your men stole from you.]
Is it loaded?
Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch?
So what's wrong?
Yeah, right...
You did something on impulse?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
You got three of the fuckers. All dead.
Hmmm?
So you were unhappy?
Pinta, do you have a pencil?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
You feel sorry for the husband?
You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself.
Did you used to?
Where's my mother?
The gunshot holds no fear. Say it.
The blocks.
You don't drink like you used to.
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
It makes it all seem so serious.
Jordan!
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
You're lying. I don't believe you.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
For an American she understands this country very well.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
He has experience in related work. A great deal of it.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
I could see she likes you.
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
Who told you that?
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
Oh.
I don't think I remember him.
Who?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
That's my son Thomas's baby.
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
When was this?
What they say?
It pains that they should do this.
You come up here often?
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
Wadda you think?
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
Marty...
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
What?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
What time is it?
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
Hello, Ralph.
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
My son Frank, he was married when he was nineteen years old. Watsa matter with you?
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
On accounta...
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
Tommy!
Tommy...
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Nice looking kid. Going to be okay?
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
Epidural hematoma?
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
You  must  open  me  up  again?
But first will you please kindly shut the goddam door?
Wisconsin.
Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
Well, there it is. Jesus!
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
That there Frank Burns is a menace. Whenever a patient croaks on him it's either God's will or somebody else's fault.
Hail to the chief! We-all got a responsibility, men. He's crowned like a king ought to be, but he can't just walk to the Mess Hall by himself. He has to be carried by native bearers.
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
How come nobody knows about him? And you do?
Now wait a minute, Hawkeye. I come a long way, learning to put up with a couple of crazy Yankees, but...
Look at the size of those two beasts.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
I was just asking...
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
Gimme three.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
And there it is.
I only wanted to know what she's like in the sack. Do those big boobs hold up or are they kind of droopy?
A-negative. I've cross-matched it.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
It's a bedroom where a man is always at his peak and doesn't have to take any time outs.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
I'm not so sure the goddam thing's in his heart.
Christ, it's Ho-Jon!
I don't feel anything.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
He only lasted one season.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
That kind of familiarity is inconsistent with maximum efficiency in a military organization.
What's the matter?
How did you get called that?
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
Very happily married.
And absolutely determined to be faithful to my husband. Do we have that in common, Captain?
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
It's terribly hard. Sometimes the temptation is just too much.
He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
You don't go after the local scrunch?
Why can't you look at him?
He's coming to.
No, never in the slightest.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
How much time do I have?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
It's a nice idea. I mean it has style.
What's wrong with you?
Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Good morning, Colonel.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
Yeah?
Okay, I'm closing up. Everybody relax.
What's the bastard really like?
As long as there's a pile-up, we can do our bit to encourage his permanent withdrawal from the contest.
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it?
Action?
Who?
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
How much money do you get?
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. WellI don't quite know what to say . . .
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
John Doe.
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Looks all right
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Duets? But can we trust him?
What's the idea?
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!
Baseball?
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Yeah, Boss?
Who's got him?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
St-rike!
Grubbel's here. See? 
Well, anyway, II guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
I want it as soon as possible.
Well, I'm stuck with two and twobut I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.  Where do you come in?
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut andI'll eat him.
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Flowers.
Oh!
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Say, who's putting up this dough?
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
I still gotta do it. Wasting time is half my job.
What's the line?
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Don't make do it, Mike.
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
Tell me what's wrong.
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Hi, Roper.
That's right.
It's all there.
How did you like Toronto?
How are we gonna get him out of there?
You got a girlfriend?
You tell me.
Yes.
You know why I like the track?
I bought you a four-six exacta box. You owe me twenty bucks.
I'm just practicing my lying.
What the fuck is going on.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he'll be in place where he can see everything.  How are we going to get me in there?
Please. I'm begging you.
Maybe you should be.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
There is?
How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
Scott...
...the hell are you talking about?
It's Cozy Girl holding on... Cozy Girl and Backtrack...
Roper.
Are you going to make this hard for me?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
And a car.
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
Roper...
This is Halden.
It's okay.
How come I can't remember?
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
Who are you?!
God creates man, man creates technology, technology creates God.  End into beginning.
You were the one who was dying.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
But once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  Everybody dies.
How long?
What?
He had keys.
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
You're jumping to conclusions.
The only way to eject it is from the inside.
A hotel?
Christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
Who did he digitize?
An interface attendant.
Need the disk back!
I've got to get back.
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
You said we were on the same programming team.
And it meant something.
But you were with me.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Program name?
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
In the language of the Nathadians, "Nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  Now, put your hands inside the flame.
SABER TOOTH TIGER!
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates.
I see... a fox
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
You okay?
That's the only way to the Monolith...
009843... 42... 41!  WE'RE IN ALIGNMENT!
We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
Hey, boss!
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
You own a hotel, sir?
What you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. Ya know, if I keep on killin' people like I have, I won't have no more friends left!
So Chicago's been good to ya.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
And now you have everything.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
I ain't mad. I ain't even surprised. But I can't let ya fuck me. On the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
When the stiff's an Irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
Four-twenty-eight.
Tommy Reina. Good pal. Better partner.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
The deal's too good, Frankie
Luciano.
Something came up.
You could have stopped him.
We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
You and Vito are gonna pull that payroll job. Right now.
What are ya thinkin'?
Every successor will owe his loyalty to us. Together we take out Maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
Ya did good. I ain't seen the Boss so happy in weeks.
When ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
Don Maranzano. Welcome.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
We learn from life.
Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
Tell it to the Calabrian. Tell it to the Jews.
Forget it. That's past.
Why didn't you tell me that Maranzano had made you an offer?
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.
Who did this?
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Bitchin' good cake.
You sure this is...medically advisable?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
And speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
Stu?
How was it? I don't recall.
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Kimmy! What's the matter?
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
What's wrong?
Mother!
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
She's at work.  I'm her mother.
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
Really?
You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
He's an organic farmer.
Where to?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Then--this is *not* you signature, Senator?
But it *isn't*?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
What's he bringing pigeons for?
Positively not in the station! Gone!
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
How do you *like* this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Did you like the first act?
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Yeah.
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
Of all the times! Of all the times! Two months to the end of his term-- and Foley has to go and die on us--
Are you ready for him, Bill?
Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are going to gab about this appointment *any* longer, I'm going ahead and see those committees!
One minute! Just one minute!
They put up *their* candidate? Who?
*But you never asked me*!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
No. No. A signal service to the State. Yes, indeed. And not only that but-- uh--I've heard of your excellent work in leading and guiding our youth--
--And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Gosh, Pop--head of the Boy Rangers!
A pet shop?
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Uh--Senator--I thought you and me might go out to dinner together--and grab off a few monuments.
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Mr. President--
Mr. President--
Mr. President--I did not say that Senator Paine was one of those Congressmen I saw. If the chair please, I will deny that Senator Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--
Yes, sir, you bet I would.
Good evening, sir. I was just making some--  Governor Hopper!
Now, now, now--that isn't going to get you any place. Get a firm grip, Ma!
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
Well now--just to take an example-- putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. As I look at it--that dam's going to do the people of our state a lot of good--
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
*No*!
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Pardon?
Uh--have you?  Did you ever have so much to say about something--you couldn't say it?
On paper?
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Yes, yes--
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
You--don't know it, do you?
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Good! I'm going to be pretty busy tonight--
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Hello.
Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.-- Fine introduction to the nation's capital!
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
You want to see me, Senator?
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
What do you want, Senator?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
What do you think?
Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us.
Any children?
But they did take place?
Oh, thank you!
Sure. I met you.
Have you seen the papers?
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
What did you mean by that?
I've often thought about going back.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Well, here we are again.
Hello, Mary?
What's the matter, hon?
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Good night.
People have been crucified before.
Huh?
You're acting like a school girl.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
With pay!
How'd you get the picture?
Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
That's the rub.
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Stuff, sir?
He's not home, I tell you!
Thank heaven.
Come on, John. What happened?
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
It's a lie!
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
That's pretty.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
I can't find him.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
I've got one for Cobb
That's funny. Why is that?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Why, it's an artistic institution
We provide opera.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Naturally.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Look, he's temperamental.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
That ought to be fun.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
What is your name?
Where is your farm?
Is she home?
Tails tonight, sir?
No, sir.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
But she's on the telephone
Hey, did you hear that?
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
But you do therapy?
Phyllis, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout...
What are you doing for lunch?
I have eighteen more minutes!
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
Why? I'm paying for this.
You remember when I asked you about pornography --
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing? I want to know what's in here.
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...  ...I really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, I can't thank you enough for...
Althea hasn't told you?
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
It was Henry Follett.
What do you want to know?
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
And the Brocketts?
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
But you know how to drive?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
What's wrong with her?
Finally, some common sense...
Just who is here, can you tell me?
What?
Is this the treatment?
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
Transference!
Hello?
You feel violated?
You got off easy.
In maybe three or four issues.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
I've got three big ones.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Lily and I talk a bit. You know Lily, runs the coffee shop?
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Damn! What is your name?
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
But look at me now...
And the drugs?
Somebody's taking a shower down there.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Skip, I've got a problem and I need some advice.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Sorry...
I'm here for you, Doc.
I guess that makes sense.
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
Oh yes, of course.
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
Goin' somewhere?
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
The sun turning black.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
Fifty percent.
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
Yeah, I was there.
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.
Something like that.
I'm not?
Why would I do that?
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
I think you were jealous
You lied to me!
But he's just a filthy criminal?
Do you really think he'll show up?
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
Juicy?
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?
Finish the inscription, idiot!
She's my sister, actually.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Where's my gun?
That looked rather painful.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
I knew you'd know.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
And what's that?
It must have slipped my mind.
Where are you going?
Do I?
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Much less go outside.
Hey, do I look like a Man?
How about... the Savage Six?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Doc, these are my friends. We're superheroes, and we need your help.
I hope you enjoy these cigars. I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get them.
But times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. I can see you still got the style, but I dunno for sure you still got the edge.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?
Who's the artist?
Come here.
I'd better go.
Who?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Or talk?
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
I admire you.
At the Frankenstein Center.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
Just shut up and listen. Hold off the attack as long as you can. If I can discover the location I'll call you --
So, let me get this straight. You have the power to become invisible.
If someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
Oh don't start that again --
Have you ever seen him?
I'll drive.
We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted Casanova Frankenstein!
So why don't you just tell her!
Maybe she's right.
Agents?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Wow.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
It is?
This is bad.
Do we have to?
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
That was too close.
We're outnumbered twenty to one.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
And, what a great pleasure it is, indeed, to meet you, Alexander.
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
Who is there?
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Bastia -- and you?
Ah-hh, no.
Why are you carrying the dog?
My God...!  What time is it?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Thank you, Napoleon.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Were you in love with him?
Were you in love with any of them?
Promise.
Separate bedrooms?
Who is it?
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
What the hell is the matter with you?
Do you know what you're saying?
How do you know?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Come in.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
I know Alexander.  His imagination must be struck by some great, bold, powerful stroke, and he will come back to me, just as he did at Friedland.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
It's cool, but where's the water?
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Stretch it out.
Who are you?
Sorry, bro, reflexes.  How did you do that?
Nobody!
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
Man, this a cool house.
Why?
You better stop running from that girl.
Blow.
What we gonna do?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
You make it sound so easy.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
Karla.
Hello, remember me?
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
You did all this for me?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
I did.  Is that door locked?
Next time, page me first.
I don't play for no team.
What it smell like?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
You coming in?
My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
What kind of activity?
See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after work, I got the John Blaze shit for you.
I can't give you your damn money back on this.
That the big one, huh?
Are they still out there?
Today ain't my day.
I do.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Roach...Roach, come on.
Ah damn.  Damn.
Where's Craig?
Tape his mouth shut.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
I got your message.  Where's Craig?
You didn't call the Sandwich Joint with a urgent message?
Need to lose some weight.
Elroy, what happen?
Don't remind me.
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Where to, sir?
Amtrack?
You just come in on Amtrack?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
What?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
This? I've never even fired one.
Good luck.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!
Yes, yes, I understand.
You're out of your mind.
What about the gun?
How should I...?
You killed him.
I killed you.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.
All right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me?
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
No. Kisses to you.
You got anything smaller?
Can I get out to Flower Street from here?
Mister, what are you dragging me into?
Who?
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
Meet Irene.
Irene is going to help.
What are you going to do!?
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
Fuckin' A.
You stole that.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
Where are we going?
Close your eyes.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.-
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Leavin', boy?
And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard about that plan, what do you reckon they went and done?
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
What's wrong, Mother?
Just went?
Twenty-five wives!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
You go set down by the River.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Hing, hang, hung.
You swore, Pearl!
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
It's all here.
Where are we goin', John?
John, where's your folks?
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I'll see to Pearl.
What are you doing, boy?
Now where, boy? Mind; no tricks. I can't abide liars.
John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
I'll tell you a secret.
Now it's your turn.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
John's bad.
Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all my wandering. Didn't nobody never tell you that, Ruby?
What's their names?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
The first night?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked in that door I'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. Ain't that right, now?
Get up, Willa.
Do you want more children, Willa?
Are you through praying?
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Them kids is yours?
She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
How long's this been going on?
Okay, good. She's asleep.
Oh my god, oh my god...
Worked like a charm.
It's just a stupid cat.
M'god, I look twenty years old.  You have any weird dreams last night?
You believe in the Boogey Man?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Me?  Wait a minute, you can't bring someone out of a dream!
You crazy? Hit him with what?
How you doing, pal?
Decide to take a day off after all?
Dad -- what you doing here?
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?
She lived there.
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
Where you think you're going?
Mother, for petesakes.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
I must be going nuts...
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
Mom, I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger.
Someone else was there.
No.
Anyway, I'm too tired to worry about the creep. Couldn't get back to sleep at all.  So what you dream?
What is it, Ninotchka?
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
What are you serving?
An evening gown.
A dress you wear in the evening.
You feel it, though.
And how is Lord Lavenham?
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
We don't like Razinin.
We had to take it on account of the safe.
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
What a lovely room you have here.
How are things in Moscow?
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
Good morning, Your Highness.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Good evening, Gaston.
What time have you, Gaston?
I am, Gaston.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Yes, monsieur?
What's new?
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
If there is anything we can do for you...
How are you, you three scoundrels?
That's two weeks from Thursday...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
Give me another double brandy.
Private.
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
How long do we have to wait here?
Can I help you?
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
Yes, it is.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Then you don't want me to go there.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Is that customary?
I will start with you.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
Thank you.
Oh, let it ring.
I must go.
I didn't follow you.
Must one always be after something?
Just smile.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
It's nine o'clock.
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
Go on.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Those newspaper people?
Oh, Leon!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
Did I hear something about jewels?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
That bad?  Old or young?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
Now, please, Swana.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?
Where to, madame?
You're lawyers.  How can you let this shit go by!  Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.
Mr. President, Hunt wants more money. Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to the hang-out route, John.  A full and thorough investigation ... We've cooperated with the FBI, we'll cooperate with the Senate.  What do we have to hide?
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Hunt?  Howard Hunt?
Pay him.
Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
We can't touch Hoover --
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
If you resign, you can keep your tapes as a private citizen ... You can fight them for years.
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
On the list of horribles, I know what he is.  And I know what he tracks back to.  You say he was involved in the Plumbers?
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
But what are we paying him for?
I suppose you thought the Presidency was above this sort of thing.
Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's group.  Get the bald guy, he's great ...
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
Mr. President!
And his staff.  Come on, the copy they were filing from China was great.
The Jews aren't the middle, Henry. They're the far left.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
So that explains his press notices. Working both sides of the fence: Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his Nobel Prize, get laid ...
I promised Iran to Townsend.
Because Harold tests thy father's will is no reason to admire him.  Let Harold's worldliness be a warning to thee, not an example.
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.
Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond well to humor.  Maybe if you talk to Mother she can ...
Current levels may not be sufficient.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did you hear what he said in Oregon? About me having too much power.
It was the poorest lemon ranch in California, I can tell you that.  My father sold it before they found oil on it.
I never met the man.
Or he'll steal it like his brother. He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar ... He had the IRS audit my mother when she was dying in a nursing home.
How the fuck did you know?
Why, you got a customer?
Let's get the fuck out of here, shall we, ladies?
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
So, what's this about, Dick?
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
It's your people who are leaking to the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard?  He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
Can you imagine what this man would have been had he ever been loved?
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
It was illegal, what he did.
The lie?
Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
Uh, wait ...
Jesus Christ!
You're doing the right thing, Dick ... don't let 'em shake you.
Where you from?
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Hi.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
We got the press this time!
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
What's in there?
So I'm supposed to be ...
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
Or we could write "expletive deleted."
It makes us human ...
I'll concede in the morning.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy ... We belong together.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
This.  Above all.
Because ... I have to relax.
Penny for your thoughts.
Congratulations, Dick.
Tomorrow.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
It'll be over soon.
Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
What?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
How you been, Ellis?
Want a cup?
How fresh is this coffee?
That man that shot you died in prison.
How come're you doin that?
Who's he in trouble with then?
Yes ma'am?
Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
...You ride Winston.
But you don't believe it.
...Now that's aggravating.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
Yessir.
Yessir. It was punched out.
I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
...Could I get you to call Loretta and tell her I've gone to Odessa? goin' to visit with Carla Jean Moss.
I thought it was a car afire.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
...I love you more'n more, ever day.
...Be careful.
Don't get hurt.
It ain't even three years we been married.
I wouldn't worry about it.
...You got no cause to hurt me.
Not like that. Not like you say.
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Llewelyn!
Goin' where?
...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.
You can't afford one?
What should I do?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
Hello?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
Huh? What is...
...I know where you are.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
This. And the gas.
Didn't mean nothin'.
Will there be anything else?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
...What time do you go to bed.
...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
Just call it.
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
How's that?
One room, one night.
I'm waitin' to hear your description of that.
I want you to take me to another motel.
Yessir.
Okay.
You tell me the option.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
No, one forty-two.
Half.
Then you'll like me.
...What do you do?
Pot metal?
So was I.
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
Some American citizens. Who do you think decides?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
...I meant your food.
Sheriff, I don't...
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
You should get the order you want.
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
Bad idea...
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
You're lying!
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
Need something else?
Do you know who I am?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
That's my son! My son is dead!
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
It's all right.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
I beg your pardon?
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
Why do they keep calling you George?
Lyla's very nice.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Thanks...
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Uh-huh.
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
What are you doing?
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
Does he know you think he's real?
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
Rosa, so you've met David?
What are you doing?
Your husband?!
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
We can live with that.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
What?
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional!  AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
I'm not telling.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
I said 'got it?'
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Can I have an evil twin?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
So how's it going with your new roomie? What's her name?
You lie, motherfucker...
Huh?
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
Damn! We gotta skedaddle!
Now wuddya suppose is eatin' George?
Whuhh...
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
What's his name again?
Finest governor we've ever had in M'sippi.
Latch right on to that tit.
Devil his due.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
Where's your ring, honey?
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
All's well that ends well, as the poet says.
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
Fact of the matter - there never was!
This is crazy. No one's ever gonna believe we're a real band.
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
It's bona fide!
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
You... in the Navy?
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
What's your name, boy?
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
I want to fly, sir!
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
I know.
Hi, son.
What did you call me, boy?
Before that.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No, sir!
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Is your brother a flyer?
How late?
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
How did it go with you guys?
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
What did you tell him about the baby?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
Do you go to school?
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I don't want you to move.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
I'm looking for Sid.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
Could you believe those girls!
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
Thanks for covering for me.
Sid, what happened?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
What if she called the cops?
He said open it.
Yes.
Th --
Are you okay?
You're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  You don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
Get the fuck away from me.
NOT THAT ONE?!
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
She said she did.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
And we're never getting in.
Yeah?
Can we come in?
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Push that button for me, will you?
Watch your mouth.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?
Something's weird.
Shoulda got an apartment.
Fuck him.
Yeah.
Are you freaking out?
Why did the chicken cross the road?
What, what, what is it?!
Morse code?
Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
He'll do something.
Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
What if I spazz out?
Tyrone...
Alma I told you to...
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
What are you crazy?
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
Cy... Cy... Oh shit man... who did this to you. Was it the pigs?
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
...at least that takes Bobby Seale off the street...
We're working on that...
Well, then we're going to take that power away from those bastards.
We'll get them. Right now we got to worry about being armed and ready to protect Betty Shabazz. Those phonies sure as hell can't. We need guns.
You're a little old to be a school boy aren't you brother.  Cool it! You're probably not the only one they've gone after. Stall a little so they believe you're for real. Make them trust you.  Hey Tyrone, you figure feeding our children is gonna make The Man jumpy?
Alone...
We put our lives on the line today. Malcolm X's widow was on the line today. And your guns weren't even loaded.
We appreciate your help with this.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
Listen Judge, Oakland's Panther International Headquarters. We shut the Pig's infiltration down here, they're gonna think twice about running their games on other chapters.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
You're a smart brother... you should dig what Huey and Bobby got to say...
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
Sorry man...
We'll all get out of here together.
Rose, what the hell you doing here?
Unh... Unh Man... I don't take no money from friends that need help. Fuck no. What do you think I am a bum?
Ain't no one seen him.
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
I know him well enough?
They're from good stock on their mother's side.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
Of course, I do.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Shall we proceed?
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
And if I triumph, you triumph.
Do you see that, Colonel?
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Is that why the Assembly was convened?
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
Colonel, I didn't request this transfer because you're my father. I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Did your father teach you humility?
These four wagons must be his.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
No, I don't.
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
You don't hate him.
A long time ago...
You were an Englishman then...
We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
We saw.
We're a breath away from losing this war.  In the North, Washington is reeling from Valley Forge, running and hiding from Clinton and twelve thousand Redcoats.  Here in the South, Cornwallis has broken our back.  He captured over five thousand of our troops when he took Charleston and today he destroyed the only army that stood between him and New York.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Don't touch him.
It is ended.
Yes, quite, but you should know that...
How far away?
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
Who might you be, little Miss?
It's gorgeous!
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
Is he really all right?
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
Yeah, sure.
Jud Crandall. I live just across the road.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Was it Pascow?
What were you listening to?
Not yet...how much further is it?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
Doesn't look like they last long.
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
Rachel not feeling well?
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
I'm going to try to do better.
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
Hah.  Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot.
Jack, I don't trust you, and that's a fact.  Never trust a smiling man, you can lay to that.
So how did you get off that island, anyway?
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Man overboard!
Did he speak?
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
I know the code.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
I'm glad we got here in time.
You?!
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything.
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?  You two weren't invited?
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
What's your name?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate?
You cheated.
Move!
Are you familiar with that ship? The Black Pearl?
Never.  They took Miss Swann.
I can get you out of here.
Why are brothering with that?
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
I swear, you look just like him.
Will -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid --
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
No.
I think he's telling the truth.
Commodore --
Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
I can explain it.  Attempted murder wasn't enough for him.  He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
How apropos.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
I know what you're doing.
You can't do this!  You owe me, O'Brien.  I made you plastic!  I made you!
Like rotting meat.
She did not.  The mouse ran down the drain.
Icky!  What's happening?
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
But, Poppy, you don't know what this means --
A containment crew is going to attract a lot of attention.
You know how I feel about you.  You know how much I need you.  How much I trust you.  I would do anything for you.
Consideration?
I was wondering if you'd finished considering?
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Yeah, I do!
Yeah?  So what?
What is it with you litterbugs?  Is it a territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?
You were never invited to my house.
I don't believe this is happening...
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
What's it smell like?
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
The big house.
Do you ever wonder what happened to us, Susie?
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
They did it to me!
... just like the mouse.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
What are these?
Pills... you know how I feel about pills.
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Susan!
Look at this!
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
Just like old times.
Did you go?
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
Oh no!  Argon!  We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot!  We have to get the nanobot!
Argon's private lab.
Susie... I...
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
What would happen if I threw him into the core?
You're not going after Argon!
Things do change.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
That's impossible.
Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
I could have you fired right now.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
That's considerate of you.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Just listen to this  Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely!
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Do you like them?
I know that.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
I'm not going!
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Yeah!
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Who are you?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
That's a canary, sir.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
That's a lovely dress.
Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's husband?
You what?
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Hey, Gallagher!
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one.  What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Traps shut!
Now don't be absurd, Smith  May I come in?
Thanks. May I sit down?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
We just thought that
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
I'm sorry nobody could come.
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
What's going on here? Who is this woman?
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
You try it.
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Yes sir.
Yes.
What?
Does it look okay?
Having kind of a tough time.
What?
Wait ...
You can't go out there.
Like a drum.
Bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... In fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  That's IF she can learn to bake.
I don't know if I ever said this to you before, but, well ... I think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
Oh yeah.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
Sure is pretty.
... Why?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
Maybe you can't even describe it. Maybe you only know it when it's gone. Maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  You might even call it "love."
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
Oh my gosh. What's he gonna to do?
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
I think I've got something to say.
"It was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
No, not that hedge. The other one.
What are you doing?
Pleasantville Marathon?
Oh my God.
Oh God.
I don't believe this.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Those are my friends.
I could like kill a guy with these things.
Couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  If you need anything, I'll be right over there.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
You're reading?
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
This thing works. We could go home right now.
Sure ... Where would we go?
Real rain?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Where are they?
Salesman. What did Bud and Mary Sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
I know how I'd feel if mine went out. Almost like losing a friend.
... Her father.
WAIT A MINUTE!!
Hello there.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
Excuse me?
What do you mean?
OW!
So ... I guess as long as I'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. We could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
How long do you think you've been here?
What's wrong?
... Like the other night, when I closed up by myself. That was different ...
Well don't you?
Oh, hi.
Well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
So uh ... Maybe we could uh ...
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
Well, I can't talk though --
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Yeah, but please don't do that.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Hello, this is Back.
Where are you?
Sure.
No.
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
Thank you. What do you do, Barry?
Well why don't you take your pants off and stroke it for me?
Not very late.
Uh-huh.
I know but I....how much is it?
Hello?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
You lied to me?
Hello?
There's a piano in the street.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Business is good, you're busy?
Do you have brothers or sisters?
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
What did he want?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
I'll see you later.
I don't freak out very often.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
I don't freak out.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
Where you married?
...what...?
That's right you travel so much.
If you wanted to call me back I could...
No.
No.
I don't know.
I cut myself.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
What do you mean?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
And your name?
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
Sorry about that.
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
....now: this pudding?
Hey.
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
Yes I am.
Nothing.
I know.
Ok.
I don't really remember that.
That's it.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
I'll go pay for my car.
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
Madeleine --
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
Ow!
In part, yes.
Go back to your room. Quickly.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
And --?
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
They can't be serious.
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
I have a proposition.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
What on earth would that require?
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Go to hell!
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
His wife's?
As for the author... shoot him.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
Here it is; the last chapter.
At last she arrives, my hard-won bride! Hurry, my child, and scurry inside. There you'll find such treasures await you; Marzipan and meringue to sate you!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
It's a long story, this one.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
I am eternally in your debt.
How was I to know, my darling?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
That poor woman.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
Who are you, sir?
The actor
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
And maybe we could get Mr. Warner and Mr. Goldwyn and Mr. Cohn and Mr. Selznick to play as well.
The Journal was pretty harsh to Roosevelt today.
It's not really--
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Marion--
This picture--
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
There's a different between want and
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
Cut the malarkey, buddy. The boss himself wants me to see the picture today.
Hearst?
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
The great Spanish bullfighter
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Did I ever tell you about my father?
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
Shit
He truly doesn't care if he ever works again.
They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
May I help you?
Very generous
You're going to destroy it
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud
Now don't have a fit -- but I want you to think again about doing WAR OF THE WORLDS-
For the title
This is an abomination There's no music and--
Well it' s all you've got !
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
Oh God. . .
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
Oh, no--
They wanna talk to you.
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
Believe what you want.
J.R., glad you could make it.
What's wrong?
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
Sure. What is it?
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
Who's that?
How do you know? You know her that good?
How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
Huh?
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Stick out your hands, Jake.
All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
Screw you, Jack.
What?
I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
Can you see it?
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Now, touch me...  ...here.
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
What'd you see?
What was it about?
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
Jake --
Why don't you just call him up?
I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
Hi, Tommy. How are you?
Hey, leave the kids alone.
Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
This is Doyle's house.
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Name me a better photographer.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
Feel a little foolish?
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Did you ever own a saw?
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
For what?
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
I'll send you some comic books.
Something wrong?
Jeff --
Can you get me that ring back?
I can't. The police have it by now.
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
You're never going to marry?
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
A Federal offense.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
No.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
What do you need money for?
Ten here.
Who's Thorwald?
And your stomach?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
What a day I've had!
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Yes.
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
What do you think?
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
I wonder where he's going now?
What doesn't?
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
From his landlord -- once a month.
I hate funny exit lines.
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag.  During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
What for?
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
What's that?
Hey, he's real abstract and different.
Just him.
What you say your name was?
This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
I like you, you know?
How'd he get in?
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
You awake?
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Hey--I want to ask you something.
What would you do, Dad?
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Go ahead.
Will you let him tell it!
Except yourself!
Son--this is all happening so fast--
Excuse us a minute?
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
Who's there?  Anyone there?
John Crawford?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
What?
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?
Who has?
Hey where'd you go?
I don't want you for my father!
You crazy nut!  You crazy, crazy nut!
Plato?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
What?
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
How!
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Okay--
See?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I'm getting that way, too.
Sure.  Lots of times.
Why did you do that?
What?
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy?  Do you enjoy that?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Didn't you forget something?
He wants the money.
He wants... your "sister"...
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Slinky's in aisle five, Twister's in aisle one, Moon Mud's in aisle four.
Gotta be ten degrees out there.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Ashley, Jesus --
You forget where I work?
Well, I don't know about that --
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
You motherfucker.
No, Nick, no --
Your pen palls dead, lady.
Nick died for me....
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
They've never done a robbery?
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
He wants to see your map.
He says he wants it now.
I saved your life.
He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
What?
But I never said Rudy.
So you could get with my sister.
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
I had better sex in prison.
You knew the place --
What?
What the fuck are you talking about.
You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Can't be attracting attention, right?
Hey. They got a shitload of cookies.
Who's robbin' who here, Gabriel...
Where the HELL did he go?
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
I can't go back to Vegas...
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
How long ago was your makeover?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
Buffet. Whaddya think it is?
You gotta get someone upstairs.
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Three days, man.
Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Don't move, Rudy!
GUARD! GUARD!
Tell her... I'll be there ...
POP! That was My card!
Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money!
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?
I'll call somebody.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
What's this?
What?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Toby... who the fuck is Toby? Toby... Toby... think... think... think...
Wong?
Why can't we pick out our own colors?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
What's the cut, poppa?
Okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. Wait a minute, who didn't throw in?
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
I know.
Your name's Freddy something.
Follow you where?
Why?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
Do you know what this is? It's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.
You really think we were set up?
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
Nope.
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute.
What?
No shit?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
So, is he dead or what?
So what is it?
You didn't tell him your name, did ya?
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
Of course.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
But the rest is right.
Are we leaving?
Don't you trust me?
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
I won't have you fighting over me.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Why?
Where'd they go?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Go on, hit me.
You know what she asked me?
Half of them are mine.
You'll live.
Yeah, how did you know?
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
I figure we'll get along just fine.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
I tried my best, but these things take time.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
Why, yes. They're all I need...
What comes after Z?
Then I know my alphabet.
I found a picture of his wife.
No, I won't let you do it.
Hey, Brenda.
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
You know, Buddy, about this friendship thing...
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Cindy, I've been thinking about this whole friend thing. I never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... I mean, there's Ray, but he cares for me in a different way. You know, bringing me flowers. Running my bath water. And then there's nights I wake up screaming and I look over and Ray's in my bed. Holding me. And seeing that tonight might be our last night together, I was thinking...
Better try a little higher.
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Listen to me I --
What should we get?
Good-night, Cin. I'll be next door if you need me.
Where's Shorty?
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
Hanson, please.
This can't be happening?
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Huh?
Oh.
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
Am I cool now?
Professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
Got a problem with that?
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Here you go, Professor.
Cindy Campbell. Classic abandoned personality disorder. She seems guarded, but willing to do this.
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
Are those cameras all throughout the house?
My God! Is she dead?
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
Ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. What do you use on it?
It's the best seat in the house. I warmed it up for you.
Alright... I might need your help.
You mean to tell me we're dead!
She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
Father, are you okay?
Yes.
No thanks.
Yo son, check this out.
This part removes the sense of humor.
"Ray!"
BLOOD FEAST!
What a bitch!
0h, shit!
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
Here we go again.
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Yes murdered! You said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. I don't know... maybe Mom's nuts!
Well, your mother's going to PTA today.  We'll see what your teacher has to say. 
Sorry, ma'am.
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
In here, Mom...
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
I can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  Goodnight, honey. Don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
Goodnight, honey.
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
"P" as in...
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Who's voice was it, Dottie?
Objection! Argumentative!
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
The police are tracing your call right this minute.
FUCK YOU TOO, YOU ROTTEN WHORE!!
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
What did you just say?
So you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
It's him!
You got your wish.
Beverly, are you alright?
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
I'll take this instead.
You know who I am, August?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse   -- used a phony health inspector's badge  they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
We can't stand here all night.
When I wanted to.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
I'll give you a check.
About forty-five dollars.
Why, Mary --
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
What did she want to know?
The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
Yes, of course  but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
The people at the restaurant?
What brought you down here, Greg?
Please - I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you - you know that?
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister  whom I had lost and have found again....   
But I understand her. That may be more important.
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I don't know.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me -that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
I had begun to write again -that's whet I was doing when you came in.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Why can't everyone be happy like we are -- laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one  so sad because she can't find her sister. And that man with her - he doesn't make her laugh  he just sits and talks.
And the other was Judd?
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
Wait - there is that other favor.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
Yes. You could become a country wife -- fool around with petunias and pullets.
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
But she told him, Frances. She told him about us.
I'm sorry to be late, Natalie.
Sorry. I'm nervous. This is very trying for me.
You have only to stretch out your hand, take up the glass and drink a little.
Well...
Oh, uh-huh.
You mean like "time flies"?
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Mother, father, sister.
I don't know.
Would you mind?
You are?
Does it bother you?
Aren't you?
So you don't believe in therapy?
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
Hi!
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Donna?
No.
About sex?
And they just answer them?
Yes.
Yes, I have. I will.
So you do fantasize?
Can't.
That's correct.
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
And you feel the same way with John?
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Like maybe a big part?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
All right, you want to talk about lies, let's talk about lies, Ann. Let's talk about lying to yourself. You haven't been able to sleep with your husband because you're no longer in love with him, and maybe you never were. You haven't been honest with yourself in longer than you can remember.
Don't do that.
Tuesday. I had a late lunch.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
I'm not either!!
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Why?
Bastard...
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
No, he left last week.
Do you want to leave therapy?
I hate my sister.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
Lose something?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
No, it's nothing like that.
Yes, I did.
Because I wanted to.
He wouldn't do that.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
Here it is.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
Do I know you?
I just want to know why you're here.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
And that's all?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Prettier than Ann?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
I wish you'd quit that bartending job.
I'm intrigued.
When?
Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Yeah, it's not bad. Usually Ann has some serious salt action going. I keep telling her, you can always add more if you want, but you can't take it out.
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Give me your keys.
Mr. Millaney?
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
You're the one who found the bodies?
Is that the man who called you up here?
Kiss, kiss?
Well? Supper at my place?
But where are you going?
You say something?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
I'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few X-rays taken. I want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, OK? Give them this. The address is right there under Radiology.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
So who changes?
Yes?
Yeah, well, I'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
BREAKING OUT
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Introduce yourselves.
When do I get to see Brad?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
We're the experts.
Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
Care to indulge?
That's us.
YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
Mental instability?
But they only think they're happy.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
Poor Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.
I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
I NEED SOME
You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
. . .For his own good.
Our speciality.
CRIMINAL
This could be worse than the old series.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And none of them worked?
It's Christine.  Hey you.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Bye.
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
How's it hanging, Miles?
You got it.
Is it chicken?
What happened to you guys?
Hi.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Whoa, why are we getting off?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
We're on.
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Pull yourself together, man.
Later.
Oh, boy.
You should call her.
Does she know about Saturday?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
What is it?
Is it the money thing?
With Maya.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
We're on.
What?
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
Let me use your phone.
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Well?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
What's wrong?
What the fuck!
This is good. Little hints of clove.
I'm having the salmon.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Is she sleeping or...?
So what's your novel about?
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Okay. See you around.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Hello?
That was big of him.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
You quit drinking?
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
French or American?
Sir, what are you doing?
What's everyone ordering? Then we can sort out the wine.
Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
See you, Miles. You take care.
What are you thinking about?
It makes me feel better.
There's dust in it.
A hair.
I think it's contaminated.
The same windows.
I'm scared.
You do?
Five. The five longest.
I cursed.
Do you think it's a possibility?
How can you say that?
That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
Chicken Teriyaki.
This is going to do nothing.
We won't be able to get out of there.
Merrill --
They're distracting us?
It needs batteries.
It's still making the noises. It's broken.
Morgan?
Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
Dad.
I don't think so.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Don't do it!
Some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle Merrill?
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
Emmett.
I didn't know you were out.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.
I almost didn't.
McKendrick's men got him.
Kate?
Gotta go.
More than enough.
Paden sends his best.
You're not Baxter?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
South of here, past Chimayo.
I see what you like, she's mighty pretty.
What's Turley like?
Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
What about the law?
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.
Augie's going to grow up here. There's nothing wrong with the land, it's just some of the people.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Where's your brother?
New record.
Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
What's stopping you?
He must be pretty good.
Appreciate the loan. I'm good for it.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Nifty.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
How about you?
Stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. Treat him right.
A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
-- What's wrong with that?
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
The picture's dead.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Why not?
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
Where are you?
You look so, so...
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Hal, what are you doing?
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
You have to see her.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
How?
One thing bothered me.
Good-night, Daddy.
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
About you and mom?
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
It's a hotel.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Thank you.  It's not important.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
A star is...
See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
--My God.
Are you calling me?
Goodnight, Malcolm.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
Don't step in the horse manure.
What were they hiding from?
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
No.
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Know what?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
What kind of words?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
Yes.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Can I ask you then?
I'm going to transfer you. I know two psychologists that are exceptional--
You weren't a paper champion.
Are you wigging out?
I wish I were somewhere else.
You know that accident up there?
A lady. She died.
You can see her?
Excuse me?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
Good for you.
Your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Just talked to Orwell down at the garage. Says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
How would you know? You're looking at my tits.  Jesus, Carl. Your job is to keep us on the road!
Dammit, Carl!!!!
You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
Motherfucking soundman! I couldn't hear myself sing!
That's not patricide. Patricide is when you gun down your old man.
Nike specials. Two hundred bucks.
Curt Cobain.
Should we be doing this, dude?
Carl! Oh Carrrrl!
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Sure. What do you want to know.
It's time to make amends.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Hey. Could you be a little more insensitive? We're on our way to a funeral for Crissake.
Asphyxiation. Choked to death on a ham sandwich. Next.
How does it feel, Keith?
Getting ready.
Strange... I can feel my old self coming back...
Suzie --
Wait a minute --
Listen to me --
Like your guitar break.
Someone better tell Mac.
How are you going to find him?
What's she see in that douchebag?
Where are you?!
What the hell are we going to do?!
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
Are you nodding?
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
Where's the old half--Mexican?
Meat.
Sure thing, killer.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Where are you going?
Who's that?
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
He took him over. His body. His -- his brain, everything what he knew. He's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. He liked being human. Didn't want to change.
When one sees you they all see you.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
Why're you driving so fast?
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
But you could get killed, right?
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Where you from?
Seriously?!?
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
An unmarked police car.
What are you gonna do when you get home?
One to five?
What can I say?
Why should I?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Loud and clear.
I hate to say I told you so.
Bandit I, do you copy?
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  Hear that? Where's his chow?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
We're outta motion lotion.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Breaker. Breaker.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
But if it can't be done, how's he gonna do it?
Five thou.
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Yes, but no -- we have personnel stationed at both ends of that hall, twenty-four hours a day.
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Deputy, have you made any ID's?
No.
Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
Who?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
...I forgive you Darwin.
About cocaine... and the amount you're doing.
What happened?
Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
...I'm sorry...
I am. Yeah.
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
Baby, I've been co-habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. These are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and I feel beaten by them, I feel bloodied --
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
Buddy, they revoked the deal, they pulled it...
A marked man gets wise and wants to come in.
Where's Israel?
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
You're trying to save Sparazza?
...So you knew all this and yet y--
Buzzy... Buzz...?
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
I'm working on it.
I feel like I know you girl. I feel like I've known you forever.  You gonna lemme see your scars?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
What'd you say?
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
Gibarian.
You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
How much sleep do you need?
Probably.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  That proves that --
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
They come when you sleep.
What are they?
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
You want to fuck her?
What do you remember?
Do you remember Beethoven?  The Beatles?  Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
Is it intelligent?
You still don't believe in God?
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
Where've you been?
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
Why did you say those things?
What's wrong.
What are you talking about?
Can you sleep?
You don't want me.
What's happening to us?
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here.  You are her, you are Rheya.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
We thought you'd be alone.  We want to talk about...
Occasionally.
Are you nervous?
Let's get a drink.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
Yeah.  It was.
No dog.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
Stop, will you?!
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
"For"...?
You still going away?
I like your coat.
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Tommy...!
My ass if falling.
My ass is falling.  It is.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Bought it.
She took you shopping for a tie?
Why?
What?
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
What did you watch?
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Ellie...
What about when she identifies him?!
At my house...!
Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.
Hold it...!
How do I know that's her?
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
How about dinner tonight?
She's what?
Time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
You're so responsible it's disgusting. But you're my only friend... do you hate me?
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
Now tell me you love me.
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Would you cool it already?
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
No refund on the mask, y'know. Health laws.
You're making my life difficult.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
Some things you should say anyway.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
I hate--
My my.
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
What are you doing this weekend?
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
You sure about all this?
Of course.
There's nothing in there worth stealing!
I'll introduce you.
Absolutely no class.
A match made in heaven.
Peter, you're bleeding.
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
In this obsolete little cyclotron, I'm solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th Century.  With more power, I could--
Then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
Why? It is a wrestling match, or
You're sure you're all right.
Excuse me if I'm impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
Do you... live around here?
Spider-Man, be careful!  He's quite mad.
Jawohl.
Ready?
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
Why not? Just one of the boys. Sharing our bunks. Eating our chow. Right in amongst the ones that beat me up. Except that he beat hardest.
If you don't want to tell me, why don't you tell Hoffy? Or Security?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
Next we're going to auction off your department store -- and your stable.
Have a cigar.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
How did he get over there?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
Let's blow, Chauncey.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
Jawohl.
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
Why don't we accept, Animal? The worst that can happen is we wind up a couple of lamp shades.
Shut up, Animal!
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
To the Brick Kremlin!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
That Schulz pig. I'll get him yet.
Why don't we just look in those footlockers?
Do Grable.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?
You're crying, Animal.
But it's not just those legs. It's that nose of yours I'm crazy about. That cute little button of a nose!
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
It's not Schulz. It's that stoolie. Whoever he is, he's sure batting a thousand.
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
What radio?
Stay out of it, Sefton.
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
How do they know?
You off your rocker?
Go on.
What are we going to do with him?
Price. When I go I want you to give me five minutes. Exactly five minutes to get Dunbar out of that water tank. Then you throw Price out into the compound, nice and loud. He'll draw every light from every goon tower. It's our only chance to cut through. What do you say, Barracks' Chief?
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
When the Krauts find that gadget they'll throw us all in the boob.
So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
Just getting acquainted. Trying to make one friend in this barracks.
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
The what?
I do not want those cigarettes.
I'll make it five hundred!
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
From a chicken, bug-wit.
You're not disposing of those Russian broads?
Where is he now?
Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
Captain=8A
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than...
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
That's where he's going.
"Lifeforms tiny little lifeforms. Where are the lifeforms-"
Approximately forty-seven minutes, sir.
Is she still angry?
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
What?
Data, this isn't the time.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Soran?
Can I?
Well, may we have a look around?
We don't have a tractor beam.
Beautiful day, isn't it?
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
Oh
The first thing you learn as captain is how to cheat death.  Scotty?
Aye.
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
Oh, I forgot to tell you. While you were unconscious, I injected a nano-probe into your bloodstream. It's been navigating your cardiovascular system, and right now I've attached it to your left ventricle.  A little trick I picked up from the Borg.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Is there a problem?
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
Well, with all due respect to your Betazoid senses, I prefer to be alone right now.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
Mr. Chekov -- ?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Calm yourself, Bones.
Do you wish to advise Starfleet, sir?
Sir... Something's jamming our transmission. An energy surge.
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
.          .. Spock's tube...
Protomatter. An unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
So, like your father, you changed the rules...
Captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
Captain, this is Saavik. We have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
Ah, Saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. What would you, ah, like to do next?
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
I'm all right -- stand by to return fire! Mr. Scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
I know you... Do I not?
Why would you do this...?
Count on our help, sir.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
Will you be able to handle that...?
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.

There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
No.
Yes. Exhilarating, isn't it!
But -- why?
... He spoke of your friendship.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Please wait!... Surely he would have found a way! If there was so much at stake -- Spock would have found a way!
What I have done, I had to do.
My Lord... what are your orders?
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
Commander, these are some of the most famous people in Starfleet! Admiral Kirk, my God!
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
You're not going in there -- !
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
What about the rest of the inspection, Admiral?
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Until now.
... come in, please. This is Reliant calling Regula I. Repeat. This is USS Reliant --
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
... taking Genesis away from us...
Wait --
You did this -- in a day?!
Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
David. Please.
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the scanner's out of adjustment --
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
I don't mean to intrude.
I'm trying, David.
What are you looking at?
Don't you believe it.
Captain... We're waiting. What's the delay?
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
Scotty -- what's left?
She's not responding...
... No response, sir.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
I believe you'll find everything shipshape, Admiral.
They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
I know of your fondness for antiques.
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
I told Starfleet all we had was a boatload of children but we're the only ship in the quadrant. Spock: those cadets of yours -- how good are they? How will they respond under real pressure?
I would not presume to debate you.
Carol Marcus --
Have they proceeded with their experiments?
They knew just where to hit us.
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.
What IS working around here?
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Admiral, they're reducing speed.
Very well.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Khan!
Reliant's command...
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
Admiral?
Cease fire. Look sharp.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
I really must thank you.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Leaving Section Fourteen for Section Fifteen.
He's not what I expected, Sir.
He's very human.
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all moorings.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Certainly...
The question is irrelevant.
Well, so much for the tour of our humble plant. I must say, Professor your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
He never jokes... Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
You'd think they could at least send a ship. Bad enough to be court marshaled and spend the rest of our lives mining borite -- but to come home in this Klingon flea trap...
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
What did you say she was getting?
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted by Man. They have been extinct since the 21st Century... It is possible that an alien intelligence sent the probe to determine why they lost contact.
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?
My name?
Ah, well done, team 2.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
No, ma'am. No dipshit.
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Here... In the park?
Permission to come aboard.
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Is there any other planet where this species exists?
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
Admiral, may I ask you a question?
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Spock... Did braking thrusters fire?
Spock: Condition report!
Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
What is our condition?
Ready sir.
Three-one-zero, aye!
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Let's see what she's got, Mr. Sulu.
We'll stick together till we get orientated. Bearing to the whales?
Admiral! There be whales here!
Ironic. When man was killing these creatures, he was destroying his own future...
The whales...?!
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
I am well, Admiral.
Genesis was perfectly named: The creation of life not death. It was the Klingons who had first blood while trying to possess its secrets.
Professor Scott, if you'll --
With pleasure.
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Hi.
Father...?
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
Do machines ever play?
No... I want to stay with you...
Hello, Data...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
A ship,
Incomplete, I might add.
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
On Earth, petroleum once turned petty thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son'a, I'm not worried about that...
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
The countdown control has been transferred to the collector...I can't override...
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
The tear is closing on us... impact in fifteen seconds...
What's inside that nebula cluster?
They're powering their forward weapons array.
The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
I... I must have slept through my alarm. I'm on my way...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?
Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked ship during their debriefings?
Debrief them again.  Have you been in a fight, Commander?
Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you returned...
Should I distribute phasers to the Ba'ku, sir...?
You need a haircut, Commander.
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
One. It's Ru'afo.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
Augh.
Initiate launch sequence.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
Is it Japanese?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
No. I will not betray my friends.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
Maybe...  Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos.
Captain --
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
There's no temporal shielding in here! We're starting to pick up relativistic effects!
Where are you from most recently?
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
You seem to have an answer for everything.
There is no invasion...
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
Track their weapons fire.
Captain, there are five Borg ships closing in on our position.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Report.
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
What are they doing?
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Or not to be -
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Jim, leave me - I'm finished...
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
I was nervous -
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair, Captain James Tiberius Kirk. I put it to you, Captain, that you were seeking revenge for the death of your son.
You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
From Starfleet?
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
They're preparing to fire.
You're forgetting something.  the data banks say WE fired. If we did, the killers are here; if we didn't, whoever altered the data banks is here. Either way, what we're searching for is here...
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe's deep in Klingon territory. If we're discovered...
Captain, I'm getting a message from Klingon High Command.
Send to commander Enterprise: "We stand ready to assist you. Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior." Attach our co-ordinates.
Your friends are late...
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
Stand down your weapons.
Aft thrusters -
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
Captain, our shields -- !
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
Me?
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace -
Captain...
Are you dining on worms?
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
I SHOULD have been -
But I am not human. I am only -
What's she waiting for?
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
Direct hit -
We can send a message to Starfleet Command -
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
I have confirmed the location, sir, but...
- could take weeks, sir.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
I've pulled out my - uh wooden shoe and Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Do you know who I am?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I dont show up for my physical on time!
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
You can' t imagine them, Jean Luc. They're kids! All with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant.
So... To happy endings.
The choices I made have led me here as well. This is the only home I have ever known. I cannot foresee a reason for leaving.
My mission was a success, sir. I have discovered the source of the Thalaron radiation.
A bit less florid, Data.
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
Yes.
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
How can you be certain?
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
I read six distinct positronic signatures, spread out over a few kilometers on the surface.
That's what I don't get -- it's mostly basic stellar cartography: star charts; communications protocols; some uplinks from colony tracking stations. It's not even restricted material.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
How long until he can fire?
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
Admiral Janeway. Good to see you.
 Believe me, we don't under- stand it either. You're the closest ship so I want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say. Get the lay of the land, If the Empire becomes unstable, it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
Sir, we've had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
Sir, we're being hailed.
What's this?
Report.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Praetor?
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
You don't trust me.
What are you doing?
And I'm not quite human. So what am I? What do you see?  Do you see a life you might have led? Lost youth never to be recaptured?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
Believe it or not, I think the cavalry has arrived.
This is a mistake.
The bond is broken.
Praetor...
And?
And bringing the Enterprise here?! What possible purpose could that serve?
I'll take that.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Recognize this?
It's real, George.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
I just retired.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
What?
What?
What?
Smile... good?
What?!
Who are you?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
In your pocket, please...
What?
What is...  ...Coke?
I want to try it.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
But I must go here.
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You did? That's funny. So did we.
What are you doing?
I like this music.
Are you angry at me?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
You are cold.
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
I love you.
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
They after you?
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Listen to this.  A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
I told you...
Is there a reward in this?
Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
That's a good one, coming from you.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
Just what I've read.  That the technology was developed for the Feds, to replace the body wire.  And now it's gone black market.  So, uh, do I get the deck from you?
What kind of things exactly?
Sounds good.
Talk to me about costs, here.
Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get someplace a little less public?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor! Double shots.  Make it Tres Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the best for my good friend Lenny, the finest cop that ever got thrown off the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.
You were lucky, Max.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
You alright?  Y'okay?
That's right.  He wants to share. Needs an audience.  This is one sick puppy.
He's been cooked-off
What stuff?
Jesus.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
I always do.
Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just have a few stops, mostly on the west side--
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
That would be no.
So am I.  Just trying to get by.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Jesus, Lenny.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
She came to me for help.  I should have read it better... I just figured, y'know... another strung- out hooker having a bad night.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
How's Zander?
Whatup Lenny?
Where we going?
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Shit!
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
It was a tough call.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
You see Tran?
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Those two psycho cops are on a slash-and-burn to find the tape and cover their tracks.
Anybody talk to the press?
Nine bodies in Roswell, now this -- it's getting a little hairy, huh?
Who knows.
You tell me.
Ripped off. By hand, my guess. Perimortal: victim was alive at the time, there's blood on his throat.
You're a... you're sick.
How did you know he was a construction worker?
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
He said it was a clue?
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
How do you feel, Agent
I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
Nothing concrete. Nothing I'd... well, nothing.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
Dick Low's a killer too.
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Why did he come out here? What's going on?
This is a sexy case.
Doesn't fit.
Yes I do.
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
He thinks he looks young.
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
Every cop has a story and every story has a girl. The girl in my story was fifteen years-old. She wore a pink angora sweater -- I can still see it -- one day, she disappeared. I told the police she wouldn't run away, I told them who to look for, but I was just a kid. I sat in the police station crying and crying. My parents took me home. The girl was my cousin and the man who abducted her was a teacher I'd had. He kept her alive a week before he killed her. The police could have saved her. Every time I see a photo of a victim I see her. That's what I want to do. I want to save her.
You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
There are Agency regulations about this.
I've been thinking about this.
Maybe we should back off a bit.
No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
You need time to think. About the case, about you and me.
And nobody else can do that?
Hello?
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
I met with Richard Low.  These are names of missing persons he has flagged. I'm double-checking every case, but I don't want to be too obvious about it. I marked the ones I'd like you to work on.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
What happened?
Agent...
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
This is Richard Low. Stay on the phone. Do not disconnect. I'm watching you. I will instruct you where to drive.
How's the arm?
Suspect Zero?
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
[Reality very risky.]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Agent Mackelway, you want to get off your ass and do something for a change?
No.
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
Michael, this is Grandma. I want to know if you got the part on that television program. I told the whole family and they're very excited to know if...  Skipping message. End of final message.
Moving here from New York was much more of an adjustment than this.
Thanks.
...Monday nights? I host an open mike...
Yeah.
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Well, thank you...?
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
What else?
To do what?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
Why don't I just wait three weeks and tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
Hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Huh?
Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
You're a comedian?
I'll have to come see you sometime.
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it.  Can I have one of these?
Yeah, hold on.
How's it going? It's been a while...
Good.  I think about things.
You know, us.
I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
Do you realize how hard it's going to be to tell my parents? I still haven't told them I didn't get the pilot.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
An eight.
That doesn't sound too good for business.
Sounds more like Aids...
Kinda money, huh?
...What's the big deal? Everyone steals from everyone.
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Him?
Uuuuugh!
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
It's kinda money, actually.
What's he do?
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
Tonight, baby.
Wake up, baby.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Cut that shit out.
Always, baby.
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
That was so demeaning...
I don't think so.
I don't know...
That's bullshit.
...Baby...
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
She was hot.
I don't think so.
What time's this party tonight?
Who? Rob?
...Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights...
I'm sorry.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
She didn't see.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
It's not like that...
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Now?
Is she looking now?
Yes she did.
...You're just poking at it...
You're money.
...Tomorrow, then a day.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Sue...
...Shut up, Sue...
And you?
Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.
The Court gave you justice.
What do you wish me to do?
Eat it, it's on the table.
You heard about your father?
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
You take care of Paulie?
I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...
I'll think about it.
My business is heroin, I have poppy fields, laboratories in Narseilles and Sicily, ready to go into production.  My importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss.  The risk is nothing, the profits enormous.
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
No...how a man makes his living is none of my business.  But this proposition of yours is too risky. All the people in my family lived well the last ten years, I won't risk that out of greed.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.
What is this nonsense?
And now, what do you choose to do?
Accept what's happened, Michael.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
Barzini will move against you first.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
I know.
Corleone.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
Things went badly in Palermo?
What is it?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Mike!  The party starting!
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
We should hear what they have to say.
Jesus, I don't know...
We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.
The Don was slipping; in the old days I could never have gotten to him.  Now he's dead, nothing can bring him back.  Talk to Sonny, talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza and Tessio...it's good business.
Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather. That is very close, a very sacred religious relationship.
I'm German-Irish.
What about McCluskey?
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
What will your father say?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
I'm Michael Corleone--this is my father.  What happened to the detectives who were guarding him?
I was worried when we couldn't get in touch with you in that hick town.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Is it going to be all-out war, like last time?
Where are you going?
Mikey, you look beautiful!
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
We're going to New Jersey?
And all his works?
Do you wish to be baptized?
I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Yeah.
Is he alive?
Uncanny!
Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
You like jazz!
Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat --
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
You're breaking my ribs!
The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
Do you have any brothers?
What does he say?
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
Shoes too?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
I've got plans!
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Why?
I wanted to tell you my plan.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Frederico!
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
Do you think you can steer this thing?
Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Oh my God. Tom.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Dickie?
I found Dickie's rings.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
It's all true.
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
Is this you?
What's funny?
Which is?
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Dickie, my God!
You're kidding.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
Questa lettera e stata trovata nell'abitazione del signor Richard Greenleaf a Roma.
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
That's good, isn't it?
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Not guilty.
Do you want me to stick around?
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
Why lie?
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening.
The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm feeling hounded -- do you think you could not give out my address?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Even her.
Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That was months ago.
I don't remember the exact date.
A few days ago.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
I have!
How much for everything.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Nah, this'll be fine.
You like ball games?
Why?
Yes?
What kind of people?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Huh?
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
The DMZ?
What hours do you work?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
Damn.
Huh?
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Just what?
He's Black, OK?
That's fine.
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
Yeah. We went to Harvard together. 
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
I have.
20 bucks?
I don't remember.
Well, I tried.
Well, you want to or not?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
God, you are square.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
What should I do? Call the cops?
You're not much with girls, are you?
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
Sure you don't want to come with me?
You don't have to.
Then it's a good guess it's grounded.
Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate?
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Also clean.
Twenty-six.
No, I want long shifts.
Who?
Sure.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
I'm hip.
Travis.
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Spit it out.
Well yes I suppose ...
I'll go.
Wait.
God's speed.
What about you, Delly?
You'll stand by me?
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
I do?
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
What did... what did I want to be?
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Nine hundred...
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Sir, that is true.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Yes... yes, I do.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Only one in town.  Get in, son.
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
No wallet, huh?
No.  But...
"It's a Wonderful Life."
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers...
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Wait'll you see the inside!
Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?
Ernie.
Carl.  Friend of yours from high school.  Everybody calls him "Cueball."
Well...
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Zackly.
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
What is it?
... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.
That's where you live.
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Why not?
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
What happened?
That you got let go.
I suppose.  Thanks.
Said as much myself, Doc.  Can't place him, though.  To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.  Well, morning's half-over.  I'm off.
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Would you like some brandy?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
And what had you done?
Then what was it?
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Yes.
Is anyone there?
Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
Yes.
I don't see what difference it makes, Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If they attacked the school, that's pretty serious.
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
Young woman cut herself.
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
We don't have any fog this time of year, Mitch.
Oh. I see.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Lovebirds, I see.
We won't be here.
They won't be.
Where's Mitch?
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
No.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
I couldn't ask you to.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Some of them are.
But how... how do you know my name?
I didn't break that window!
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
What's that?
Do you practice here?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
You like me, huh?
Right next to the one you already had.
What?
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
But not for me.
Are you all right?
I don't know, Melanie.  Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Do you want some mustard with this?
Some cream?
Melanie...
The town looks clear.
How long have they been gathering there?
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
There we are!
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
For what purpose?
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
Scotch, light on the water.
We need them.
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish.
I haven't finished my drink.
You have his promise, then?
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
I'm cold as ice.
He's not home.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
But, I didn't ask him to kill.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
I've just been to see Mrs. Marsh. Georgina is doing splendidly.  The incision has healed -- clean and fine -- but she doesn't seem to have any desire to walk.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
What do you mean, Fettes?
Did you think Gray was the only one who could handle a mattock and shovel?  I've had some practice in the art.
This is not a woman!
Are you a doctor, too?
I will not have you use that name to me.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
I would make you rich.
A pleasure to torment me?
I presume you shall.  This won't be my last visit here.
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
She would if she could.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
Crony indeed!
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
Was that it? Well, ok.
Leonard, Dutton, Erlich. They don't matter. I want the King.
Think maybe knives do?
You lied at my trial.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
What did they give you?
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
You're him. Corvis.
How do you know?
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
An accident, Nathan.
I watched her grow up. Just like you. I know how her mind worked. She kept snooping around because she was worried about you. What you'd gotten yourself into. So stop blaming me. And blame yourself.
Anything wrong?
What's with your friend there?
Look, can I just call a cab?
What were you yelling about?
Honey. It's doesn't mean anything. It's not a message.
You killed her!
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!
We sure had fun today. We saw the space ship and we went to see Professor Barnhardt -- and--
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
We certainly did.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
How does he explain that?
My name is Harley -- Secretary to the President  I've been told that you speak our language -- that your name is Mr. Klaatu.
Naturally we're very curious to know where it is you come from.
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.
Everyone seems so-- 
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--
What happened?
No -- that is a power reserved to the Almighty Spirit.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
The Professor's secretary says she found you in Barnhardt's room, making marks on his blackboard.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
But I suppose you know the answer.
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Well, how do I know who you are?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
They wouldn't be out in the daytime.
All together?
Should I run him through?
That's right.
We were gonna grab some food.
Or a vampire.
This is just our cover.  We're dedicated to a higher purpose.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
He's telling the truth!  Aren't you, Michael?
I thought they'd be in coffins.
Oh, no...
We don't have one yet.  And we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
I said, <u>I'll take you there</u>. Nobody's going near Star without me.
Ouch, my hair...
Smells good.  When do we eat?
Grandpa, stop doin' the Indian Walk!
Hi... I'm Laddie.
He looks dead.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
I <u>didn't</u> invite you in this time!
Mom, there's an amusement park right on the beach!
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Say hello to Thorn.
You're cute, Max.
Not impressed, are you?
So, I've met the one woman on the planet who's going to hold my success against me.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
Does it burn?
Well... yeah.  Sure.
When?
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
Why not?
I know, I've felt it...
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Go away.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
Did you spill something?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.
Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  Just anything at all?  Any little thing?
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Somebody broke in.
We got to burn 'em.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
What's happening?
What we going to do?!
Well, who says I want you going with me?!
... Nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
What are you doing?
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Now hold him.
I'm getting worried about you.  You ought to have a checkup.
After all this mess then.
Put that down!
How long's it been?
Four!
What's...
What kind of test?
Where were the flashlights?
He might just wait us out.
You and Nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
Get your gear on.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
We should sleep in shifts.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
Yes.  Just about here.
Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
Because you'll never die.
And if the truth is so horrible that it will haunt your dreams for all time?
Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
So, do we go on?
What's it all for?
Why did they built it?
Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
Now get out of my sight, you hideous primate.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
And centuries later when we tried to emerge into the sun again, we couldn't.  Our adaptation was too successful.  We survived... we endured... for this.
Say I just come back again?
Why?
That was a foolish thing to do.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
You know, the moment is rather dying here.
You're late.
Alex, what is it?
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
You're so pale... I hope you're not coming down with something.
Heavens, look at that now!
Alex... people are staring.
... The point is I know it will work once the, um, numbers and such are in order.
In the future, we'll be better.
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
What happened to Emma will never go away.  It's part of you now and it always will be.  But you have to learn to live with it...
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
And this would be my study.  There was an elm tree outside the window then.
Yes.
Is there a lot of illness?
His curiosity is amazing.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
And there's no shame to that.  It's all the same here.  Everyone has an important job to do.  We all work together and couldn't survive without each other.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Alexander...?
Mara -- what -- ?!
Yes, sir, he --
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Might I ask why?
We had another visitor from beyond the valley about four years ago. His name was Moren.  Do you know him?
Where do they take them?!
This is out life, Alexander.  It's a hard life but it is how we have always lived.
You won't even try?
If I might explain, sir --
We'll see about that.
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
[Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
Hello, William. I understand you've been asking for me almost every hour. I would've been here sooner but you gave our little state visitor quite a bit to talk to me about.
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
I don't know how you died. The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer...
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
How did you come to know their names?
You done with your small talk?
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
I looked it up.
I gave you my dog tags.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. [Beat] I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
But no one knew until after...
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
I might not be able to.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
What?
You gotta stop thinking like that.
I've been ok.
I don't understand.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
Exactly.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
How do you know about Eugene?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
You know how to get there?
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think...
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
MacKenzie, [beat] what if we are crazy?
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
Well, where are you from?
Of course you don't know.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Well, how'd you get here?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
You don't think that's crazy?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
How?
Hon.
Have a good day at work today.
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Why?
He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
No!
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.
Armed robber.
We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
Stop.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're just givin' him a ride to... to here.  Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't you, J.D.?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Is that how you answer the phone?
Hello...
Now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy everything.
Thelma!
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
You could help me try and figure it out!  I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
What's wrong with you?
I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very happy for you.  I'm glad you had a good time.  It's about time.  Where is he now?
Drive!  Drive away!
Holy shit.
Thelma.
I want you to call Darryl.
It won't work.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.
Louise?  Where are we?
Idaho?
Now what?
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
This is so beautiful.
Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll be darned.  What's he doin' way out here.
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better drop it right now!  I don't want to talk about it!
Sorry!
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
You do?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you?  I mean, I just wanna know.
He said they're charging us with murder.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
You know what's happened, don't you?
We've gone insane.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
What in the hell is it?!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
Go.
Where you goin'?
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Stop it!
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Nah.
Mary again.
Well why don't you look her up?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
And this adversely affects me how...?
Why's that?
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
Very nice.
Take it easy, that's Bill.
Here, just have one of these then.
The sawbones?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Don't you want to know my name?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
So...
I guess.
How's my stomach taste, she says.  Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
Urrggghh...
Are you okay?
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I don't buy it.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
Four kids, three different guys.
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Among others.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
You what?
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
You little fuck.
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Thanks for picking me up.
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
I see where you're going.
How do you guarantee that?
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
Good lookin'?
Bundt cake?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Holy shit...
Oh, are you on the team?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Hi, Ted.
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
What's that?
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
So you're a writer?
Get out.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
Ted...?
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Eh.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
See you, Warren.
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
Jesus Christ, guys. What the hell's Khruschev thinking?
There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles. Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product.
Well, I'm not.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
I'll do it.
What happened to speak when spoken to?
Jesus...
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
And?
All right, so maybe we overestimated how reasonable this trade would look. Okay? You happy? So now what?
Slow down. Smell that?
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
What's it about?
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
Don't forget, Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin. You need to do something about this.
So what've we got today?
Still think Cuba isn't important?
I don't care. Cancel it.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
I'm your political advisor, and I'm giving you political analysis here. This is a setup. The Chiefs want to go in. It's the only way they can redeem themselves for the Bay of Pigs. They have to go in, and they have to do it right. It's that simple.
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
Hello?
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
-- you sonofabitch, goddamn it, I didn't drop --
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Anyone stops us going in, we're with the Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
What's this about?
Interesting bloodline you have, Ray.  French, Scots-Irish, Italian, ...and one-eighth American Indian.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would've loved you. He'd love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.
This is a restricted area.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Couldn't sleep.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive. And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house.
Today. And now you -- there's a dog in the van --
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
Hey.  Hey, you, listen up --
You got no know-how. About Indian Way. Or about Jack Shit for that matter.
I'm talkin' his spiritual mother. Maisy Blue Legs.
What did he say?
What was he saying?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
So did this one. Wambli is a rare and sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But you think that's bullshit too, don't --
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Take care of yourself, Walter.
Cuz I'm a skin?
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Sonuvabuck! What's with you, Man? Who are you?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the Warriors involved.
This Clear Moon's house?
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
Who did?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin' senile. Now I know he is.
Your relatives must've taught you something.
What?
X21. Come back.
What ya want?
Washington sent ya. I know that.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
You turned Leo over on his face. But the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It's out, and it knows.
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
Yes, ma'am.
What would?
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
There you go with those moves again.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
Harmless!
I'm different.
No!
You're horrible
You don't have to kill it.
You ever think about killing another human being?
Does it bother you?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
You're totally insane.
Come on.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
You ever fly an F-14? 
Danger?
Doesn't it ever bother you?
That's what you get flight pay for.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
Well... What   is   it?
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Let's hope you're right!
That's missile lock!
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!
Ohhh Mother!
I've got it -- hold on!
You're not supposed to...
What do you want?
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
Did what?
So I've heard.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
I've lost him -- where is he?
Great move. Great
We did it!
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there?  Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
Come on, we're next.
What the hell is this?
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
No, we...got our butts kicked.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
GET LOST!
I don't know what to tell you, Skip.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
You won?!!!
It was bad.
You didn't help.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
So, where to?
How could you do this?  You're a mutant.
Don't bother looking.  It's in your skull.
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
I'll go encode your room key.
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
You see, Quaid, none of my people could get close to Kuato.  The fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  So Hauser and I sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
Well, Cohaagen, I have to hand it to you...This is the best mindfuck yet.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
But I thought...
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Kill him.
What the fuck is going on here?!  You can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
Two-headed monsters?
So, been married long?
Amazing.  Where are we?
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
Sit down.
What, aliens?
What trip?
I did?
Where is he?
Shit!
Is that better?
Who is she?
Let me go!
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
The hell you're not.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Clever girl.
I love you.
Let's see...the basic Mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  That's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --A longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
As real as any memory in your head.
All right.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
Forget I said wife.
I said get out!
I thought you didn't like me.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Where are you going?!
Where's this "reactor" come from?
What's wrong?
Wait!
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
Yeah, still got one poking around.
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
We're not going over there, right?
So...now what?
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
Well, whatever the hell happened it's just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
It must've grabbed us.  That's why the truck stalled-out.
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
This is one big mother!
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of <u>any</u>thing like this before?
We'll take your word for it.
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Don't he have a home to go to?
You're right, don't matter where they come from.
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
They're...they're trying to make us move!
Use the fucking bomb!
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
I'd do the same.  Well, catch you Thursday.
What?
Well, what's wrong with it?
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
Listen, got a question for you.  Do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
What's it doing?
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
Listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  Couldn't we... distract them somehow?
Demerol? What the fuck is your problem, man? You wanna die?
Forensic ballistics isn't an exact science, is it?
Ms. Vin's sister.
"We"?
What, "everything"? You shot a corpse. I don't give a shit about that -- !
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
We don't prosecute people because in the abstract they might be weak. Judge Brandeis said it best: Entrapment is a "dirty business!"
We have a full caseload, Rog.
-- Easy as that, huh?
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
A fucking wheelchair?
-- What?
Eddie... it's one thing to compare Clyde Gruner to Jesus Christ. It's even okay to claim that Shu Kai Kim is just slightly holier than the Pope... as long as you don't really believe it!
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
"The killer wasn't Chinese"... Cecil Stipe was right. .!
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
My mother find you?
Figures.
An Aryan Warrior with black teardrops painted on his face.
Afraid of what?
What went down?
...I'm dying out there.
When you leave this place you're going out to dinner or a movie or get laid. Where's our bond? I'm going back to my cell and wait to die. So tell me: Where's our bond?
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
Edward T. Dowd.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
-- Can't Mr. Dowd find his own expert witness, your Honor?
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
No.
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
And what does a soldado -- a soldier -- do?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
I'M NOT KIDDIN'. WHERE WERE YOU? WHO WERE YOU WITH?
Bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
Don't get funny with me again.
We can do it right here.
Bobby's got it.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
You try that you little monkey.
OK, Gordon.
What is it, Gordon?
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. He had me drive the van with the body back here. Which we did. It was 105 miles.
I cracked the Whiteman case with this.
He didn't suffer.
No.
Take a good look around. There's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. What'll it be?
Lil was wearing a sour face.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
A blue rose.
Accidental?
Agent Desmond, it's...
Take a look at this.
My guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
Noooo...
James called me last night looking for you.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Maybe I better start our homework.
Laura?
Goodbye, Muffin.
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
How did the car get back here?
You got it.
Bob.
The pages are gone. That's real.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
Why? It does.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
This afternoon?
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
When he finds out.
Bobby killed a guy.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
Where's Dad?
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Dad.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Leland, what are you doing?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
What's wrong?
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
You're right. There's no one here.
Come back as soon as you can.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
He was accused of jury tampering.
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
They lied.
I do. Yes.
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
...of Anesthesiology?
Uh-huh. Still practice a lot of medicine?
I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
I did.
Ed Concannon.
Mr. Concannon...?
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Say it.
Thank you. When Debby...
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
...to save her and to save the baby. Is that...
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
Dr. Gruber...
I read the hospital report on your client.
Yes.
Do you know who her doctors were?
Hi.
Mrs. Simmonds.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
Are you done?
Nothing further, your Honor...
Really. How wonderful for you.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Maybe I can do something right.
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
What happened...?
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
Joe...  Joe...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
Then why don't you testify?
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
What does it mean?  I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
Well, well, well. Huh?
...now who is that...?
Come on. Let's get a drink.
How are you holding up?
Are you with me... are you awake...?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
She didn't do anything. She took the patient's history and signed the charts. 'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
We don't have anything from the Nurse Association?
I just saw her.
What happened in those three...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Looks almost cold now, don't it?
There's only one thing that will stop the Martians!  We've held back pre- viously because of the danger of radiation to civilians.  Now there's no choice.  The United Nations has voted authority to the United States.  The White House will confirm an order to use the Atom bomb.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
They've all stopped at the same time.
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
Is that... machine...?
Where are we?
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
How long was I out?
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.
That's what knocked the phones out, too.
What is that gizmo?!
We know now that we can't beat their machines -- but we can beat them!  They are mortal beings...The only question is whether we have time enough to do anything!
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
I got a message for you.  You're the guys from Pacific-Tech, ain't you?
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!
Colonel - shooting's no good!
We will, sir!
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
So I don't know about horror.
Bob, how long has Wes been working on this script?
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
One of mom's cups got broken.
It was nothing.  We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong.  Terry and Chuck were...hurt.  You were almost...  You were even cut.
Just be careful, okay?
Any history of epilepsy in your family?
I want my kid out of here now!
Someone's coming.
You okay, champ?
Hurry back, please.  I'm sleepy.
You okay?
Heather?  You doing okay?
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Seemed, not was.
Heather Langenkamp?
Studio B.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
You sound so sure.
Well, that's all part of it.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
I walked in on my parents one time. It was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and I thought that was kinda weird so I just walked in.
Where you going?
I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All right?!
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
I thought this was your dream come true.
Why then.
He does.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
Honey, did you know that the Albatross was captured by the Germans during World War II?
How ya doing?
Good.
You all right?
Uh, huh.
Shouldn't we turn away?
What's on your mind?
Can't do it.
The Dolphin was a symptom.
But you invited is aboard.
Why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
I guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
Me, too.
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
What?  Come on...
Why, man?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
Is it true that you forced Robin Weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
And you didn't do anything about it?
Come in, Montgomery, Alabama.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
Y'all take American Express?
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
Need a hand?
How 'bout a beer?
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
No... I don't think so, man.
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
What's she doin' here?
What is it?
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
Oh, many things...
He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula and me bass fishing.
The Good Witch...
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
In what capacity?
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
What?
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
You won't of missed much.
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
What's that, honey?
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
You got me, peanut.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
You upset with me?
There's worse places, honey.
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Sail?
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
How can you say that, Sailor?
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
Have it your way... But you want it.
Take care of him?
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Simple? Kill him? How?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
Put your shoulders back.
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
It's the Chancellor.
Thank you.
Tripp!
Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
He has a book.
So. Is he any good?
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He lives with his mother.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
What's this guy's problem?
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Which is?
Want some help with that?
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
I'll be... somewhere else.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
I passed out.
I know.
Vernon.
It's just a souvenir. They don't even make the caps anymore.
Boy or girl?
Right. Well, thanks. For the lift.
I'm in Kinship. Listen, Sara, there's some things we need to talk about...
Goodbye, Grady.
It was my mother's. She won it in a penny arcade in Baltimore when she was in Catholic school.
You're not like my other teachers, Professor Tripp.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
Really? That's remarkable.
They're glass. The buttons.
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
I'm okay. I just lost my balance.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
Isn't this...?
Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my mom. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer.
Whatever kind they wanted her to be.
The one that left you?
What?
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
Where you going?
Professor Tripp...?
Yes, Hannah?
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
Professor Tripp.
New?
I'm sure.
Is that Cristaile?
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Someone stole my car.
I'm through improvising.
I know.
I guess you have to go on faith.
Who's he barking at now?
Listen, Antonia --
You mean because his career's ruined and all?
And?
Maybe I should read it.
Hardapple?
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
Are you riding with me, James?
There's so many...
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
Then what? What?!
What's happening?
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?
I've got some good news.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
Carlos, can I ask you something?
What do you mean?
There's a million birds here.
There's little chicks!  You want to see?
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
Were you watching me?
What are you writing in that book?
What does that mean?
I haven't broken any laws.
Doesn't everybody?
You walked home.
Do you believe in them?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
So. How are you adjusting?
Are you taking your medication?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
Just trying to be helpful.
No thank you.
Yes.
What's her name?
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
And how's your job?
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
Try it.
Is that what you are angry about?
I mean, when will I be normal.
How do they know?
Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
Please don't do it again.
That's not a helpful answer.
Close your eyes.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
A nap?
I don't like nobody behind my back!
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
You felt pleasure.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
You're quiet at work.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Something happened to you.
So?
Hey, that was... intense.
No you're not.
What's the problem?
Is that all?
Molested little girls?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
What was prison like?
I'm sorry, Walter.
You really believe that?
Being here, with me.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
We should live together.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Thank you.
Don't do that.
Gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  So there you were--
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
Where are we?
My rig.  I designed the damn thing.
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
You never did like being called that, did you?
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
I think you were worried about me.
No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.
But what did he see that made him panic?
What's the scoop, ace?
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
Jesus, Lindsey--
God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.
No.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
Okay, I'm gonna free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
You see where it's coming in?
Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off. You go any tools?
I don't know how!
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hello, Brigman.
We'll go in through that large breach.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Is that it?  Is this right?
'Fish'?
Hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  Only way.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Copy that, continuing forward.  You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
4800 feet.  It's official.
What kind of light?
Then how come you're not with him?
A little more so this time.
No. It's not enough... I told you before that I would like to get away for a while and be alone.
Which one shall I wear?
Isn't it fashionable any more to put on a sailor's cap with the name of the yacht?
What is that one over there called?
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
There's no comparison.
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Shall we go for a swim?
Find anything?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Then why do you say them?
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Why are you looking at me like that?
What are you saying?
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
I love you.
I don't love you.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Who are you talking to?
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Ettore...
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
Then it's impossible for her to know me. In the villa where I'm at, we have a male gardener.
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
Thank you.
Patrizia, what are you going to do?
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Did you manage to find good rooms?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Patrizia, don't start in again... I would rather be called depraved. Unless you happen to love children.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc.
No.
But she watches... she listens.
Why?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Well, who in particular?
Who?
Do you think he loves you?
Where do you meet?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
No. I was sick.
I went to my room.
I fell asleep.
What baby?
Do you have any children?
Why should I?
Sister Paul was in her eighties?  Did she climb up here often?
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
You have trouble sleeping?
What things?
Sometimes, yes.
What did you do?
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Are you intelligent?
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
I really love you.
I'm frightened.
Of telling you.
Why?
Why?
Would you like to tell me?
Did anyone else know about the baby?
And then what happened?
Who?
My bed.
For me to get sick in.
Yes.
Of what?
Is someone in the room with you?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
So I could go to him.
Him.
Are you frightened?
For what he made me go through.
???
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
Something they... that they overlooked.
I don't know.
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
???
I'll have it.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
You were a smoker?
I can beat that.
Who was the father?
And you didn't try to find out who?
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
Who?
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
When was that?
Sister Paul?
Your niece!
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
We'll see about that.
I haven't decided yet.
An unhappy woman...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
I'm out of prac...  ... practice. 
Do you want to become one?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Why must he be anybody?
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
That's what I have to believe...
Hasn't she had enough?
You wanted that child out of the way.
You tied the cord around its neck.
She can't remember.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Lay them down.
Lay them down.
Well --
Can you fix him for me?
The police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
That's not your Grandfather.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
Should I say it?
I don't think that bit's right.
How'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Hello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.
Oh!
Oh, it's the way you talk.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Oh aye, a sledge.
They ought to be.
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Yes.
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Parading's better!
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
Shush! Have they roughed you up yet?
And if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
Anything to spare?
No, that's his other one.
Aye, he looks a right lurker.
What are you doing there?
Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Oh you are, I know you are.
Well, you look like him.
Aye, but you know him well.
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
You're a window rattler, son.
It'll only get you into trouble.
Temper! Temper!
None for me, then?
Stop picking on him.
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
I'm going to buy a cattle ranch.
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.
I don't recognize that constellation.
Activate lifter quads.
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
Breathe deeply.
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Yes!
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
<u>He</u> died.
Yes?  What is it?
But we can't kill it.  If we kill it, it will spill all its body acids right through our hull and out into space.
Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid?
It's really on there tight.
We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
Yes.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
Don't worry, it won't damage it, it'll just give it a little incentive.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
The flamethrower!
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
You mean his body was still kicking when it ran off with him?
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
Isn't "bait" the word you used?
What's the frequency?
I've got it.  It's coming from ascension 6 minutes 32 seconds, declination -39 degrees 2 seconds.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
There, it caught!
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
That sounds a little fanciful...
We're going home.  We're in hyperspace.
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
We'll have to catch it and eject it from the ship.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
Let's hear it.
Zero.  Dry as a bone.
Still worried?
I understand why you did that.
We won't need it then.
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
Can you make out any pattern in all that?
That'll blow the ship up.
You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
Better?
It's a rhino.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Nice howitzer you've got there.
Minh...
A pair of incomings.  They popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
How many of them are there?
Are you alright?
Fucking great.  I invested some money in them.
Unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
How much air-time have I got?
If I can get to the chopper, I'll meet you at the rendezvous.  Don't wait for me.
Listen to what?
Forget it, man.
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Miss Noguchi!  You're wanted in admin.
What happened?
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
There's still time to back-out.
See that sheathing on the suspension? Eaten away.  Same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  The algae out here just isn't good on these new plastics.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Four.
What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
What is that?
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Think I spoke too soon...
What?
You have to...
Jesus.
How's it going?
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
'Bout five minutes.
Phoebe?
May I come in?
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
You're more than modest.
After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
You take charge.
Hungry?
She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
I don't think that's funny.
What a day - what a heavenly day...
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
What do you take me for?
What do you mean by that?
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
She was a liar, she was a liar!
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
Good luck, genius...
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
Bill...
You're my girl, aren't you?
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Okay.
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Thank you.
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Wouldn't you feel more natural taking a bow?
What fire and music?
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
I wish it were.
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Why?
Why what?
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
Thanks for your help... good luck.
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
I'm talking about you. And what you want.
- and for you.
You think?
Find out.
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
How do you do, my dear.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
You don't like Eve, do you?
You all put together?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That's all.
It was for my report.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
That's the door.
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
She's got to meet you-
Hello, Miss Channing.
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
I think she would cheer.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
May I have your coat?
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
Eve... don't cry.
He can help you.
I think I know...
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
How'd hear about it?
Well... it started with the play before this one...
Did you see it here in New York?
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
Right here.
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
Karen.  I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
Why should he - and why should you?
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
What time is it?
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
You'll break your neck on that ice.
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
All this fuss and hysteria because an impulsive kid got carried away by excitement and the conniving of a professional manure slinger named deWitt! She apologized, didn't she?
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
What's so funny?
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
I like that girl. That quality of quiet graciousness...
There you are, both of you. Max, Karen has decided it's time to go.
How's the new one coming?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do.  You were about to tell me about Eve...
I'm sure.
To you, too?
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
I never said it was!
I shall never understand the weird process by which a body with a voice suddenly fancies itself a mind! Just when exactly does an actress decide they're her words she's saying and her thoughts she's expressing?
That's right, but I don't understand-
Play it again.
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
Margo. You by any chance got bicarbonate of soda in the house?
Promise.
Are you breaking the contract?
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--I have to stand here and listen to the staff correspondent from Virginia?--
--no way--
July of '71.
What's that?
Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
See her?  Get anything?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
Republican?
'68.
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
--she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
--there had to be a White House overseer--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
California, Illinois, Florida, New Hampshire--all the major Democratic primary states.  Why does everything you play sound the same?
You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
I think that's him.
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
Woodward?
--jeeeeeeesus--
--what time is it?
The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
Sorry.  Now if it was Hunt you were interested in--
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Donald Segretti?
During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
Can't help you.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
Down to Miami and back--how much damage can I do?
Speak.
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
Hannah, I never would have bothered you but I'm off to Miami and they're gonna take away my ten speed unless I get it straightened out fast.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
I think.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
This is practically a high school reunion for us, Jane--I would have sprung for a classier place.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
I was just curious--you don't do it well, so I wondered. Have you been threatened, if you told the truth, is that it?
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
What happens when the baby comes?
--what do you think?--
Are you implying you don't believe me?
You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Someone with authority I'd imagine, wouldn't you?  Don't you know what you're onto? Come on.
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
So?
--no--
Mr. Sloan?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
You work there, Miss Abbott.
What the hell was that?
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
All right, I got some scotch.
What are we gonna hear?
What do you suppose they're saying?
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
I'll tell you, I've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  Of course, I have no frame of reference for this comparison.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
Hey, what're you doing here?
Come on!  I won't tell.
What?  No I'm not.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
So we're gonna be close next year?
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
No you haven't.
You're so big!
Hey, where's Finch?
Did I miss anything?!
But, but -- what would I do?
That's stupid.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
What the heck is this?
You're not...busy?
Dad!!
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
What was your name again?
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Yes.  Seriously.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
You guys got the Latin homework?
This was remade?  Into what?
Shortstop.  'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?
Okay...that would be cool sometime.  How 'bout tomorrow?
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
Vicky, wait.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
You comfortable?
You sure you're comfortable?
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
That was a great night.
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
You know what, nevermind.  You're not ready.
...Guess what?
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
I think you need your balls reattached.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Merde! I can't believe this!
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Salots! Shitfucker!
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Like an underground club?
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
What about your glasses?
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
I don't know...
They're coming!
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
Didn't even have to ask.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Okay. Be careful.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
Pull over! Now!
Claude...?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
Psychic awareness. Right.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Uncle Terrence?
Where is it! Please!
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Enough. Cut him loose.
What've you got?
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Are you running away?
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
Ouch!  That really hurt!
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
You never thought of the possibility?
Come on up!
Forged papers! Now, what?!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Nervous?
Do you remember this?
PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
It's her.
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
The "Odessa Dunk"?
You are the boy ...
I had nothing to do with it!
I did no such thing!
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Lyndon Johnson?
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Alvy, I...
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Well, then, w-who was?
He was creepy.
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
All right.
Oh, you do?
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
No, I got time.
Sylvia Plath.
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
No.
Here, you want some?
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
No, I'm not.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
I know you've only known me a short while.
Don't you think I do?
Yeah, I know it's small.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Oh, you have my body.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Yeah.
Well, what is your definition of following?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
I'm home!
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Will it change my life?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
David! David! I can't believe this!
What?
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Very big spider.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Here's a real present.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
God, it's so clean out here.
What?
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
What'd I do?
What'd I do?
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Here you are. There's people out there.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Bad?
Tsch, a few.
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Wait a minute! Really? Really? I happen to teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media and Culture"! So I think that my insights into Mr. McLuhan- well, have a great deal of validity.
Yes.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Sixteen years ago.
Mean?
Just give me the license, please.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
I have some very good memories there.
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
We went over to the swap meet. Annie, Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Oh.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Yeah.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
There were many men interested in you?
Did you know the contractor?
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
It has your ring.
It's going.  It's going.
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
What what's about?
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
Why didn't you bring him?
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
Never.
Not for a second.  Cal can have all that.
What is that thing?
Oh.  Do you have any pictures?
Let's get the kids.
It's not a contest.
I never put myself in harm's way.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
The suspense is killing me.
You need to call your dad.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
There's a test, you know.
Go.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
Scout's honor.
No luck.
Accept a compliment.
Kiss the back of my knees.
No.  Did you?
I mean, you're really back.
Don't get it.
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
Two minutes.
It's an unfair advantage.
Truce.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
Fuck you.
Otis!!!!
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
It's a shit novel anyway.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Cal, too?
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Panes!  How are you?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
Oh.  Well.  Good.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
No.
Not long.
Joking.
Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
Well, you know...good days, bad days.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Easy tiger.
I need to leave you now.
I've never done this before.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's very nice.
I think there are sixteen there.
What?
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
Ryan.
Well, yes, actually.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
I was impressed.
The charades.
Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
Fuck you, Panes.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Like the last time.
Like the last time.
We're just feeling our way back.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
Why not?
So tell me, how's it going?
Panes?
Monica and Ryan.
I didn't know you had this.
Happy anniversary.  Thank you for making me a part of it.
Like Joe.
So where should I put it?
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
You'll hate it in London.  It's wet and miserable.  A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized.  Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen.  Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit.  There's no excuse for pain like that.
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Someone who follows his heart!
Really?
You watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
And you are...?
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
We're going to die!
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
Why do they have you tied up here?
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
Barbatus!
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Dammit, this tunnel is priority A-1! We can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
What are you doing?!  ATTACK!!  Come on, you yellow-bellies!  Don't just stand there, Carpenter! Make an example of yourself!
Not that one.  Or that one.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
...Not enough food?
ARREST HIM!
What do you see out there?
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
So this is your mother's apartment?
Such a racket I heard in your place -- maybe you had burglars.
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
What gives, Baxter? You getting promoted or getting fired?
Oh, I never catch colds.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Good night.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
Eight-thirty.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Marry Christmas.
What gave you that idea?
I forgive you.
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
Your phone.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
Who?
His apartment?
What's your friend's name?
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
I think I'm going to give it all up.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
You are?
You sure you want to throw that card?
Who was that?
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
I would.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
In this house, you're supposed to.
Thank you.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
Shall I light the candles?
I see you bought some napkins.
We're going to finish that gin game.
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
You do?
The Vice Squad?
Sir?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
Well -- I guess so.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Now hold on, Baxter --
Baxter?
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
That Kubelik -- boy!  Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
That's okay, Buddy-boy.  Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky --  -- she's a skater with the Ice Show --  -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
What's her name?
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
How's the patient?
What's this -- you packing?
Where are you moving to?
That so.
Can I ask you a personal question?
You got a girl-friend?
Say, this is Snugsville.
No kidding.
Not so rough, honey.
Sleeping pills.
Dreyfuss.
What for?
Well -- thank you.
How long has it been -- a month?
I don't believe you.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
You didn't really believe me, did you?
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay --  That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
Which part is that ?
Delta ?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
That's quite an array of ribbons...
I was an FO for the 25th.
Sometimes.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
What are you doing out here?
Whatdoya think it thinks.
And the grass?
He killed that guy without feeling anything.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.
I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America !
What'd he say?
Flood.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em.
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
They're not Cong.
I --
Anybody see some smoke ?
They nail him for it bad ?
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Terminate ?
Spooky.
No, sir.
Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --
We don't want to bother you any, we --
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
What's your name, sailor ?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
Good swell.
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
What do you mean?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Change -- get out there -- I want'a see if it's ridable -- change.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
Fucking savages.
You were not coming here, to see me?
No -- I don't want to sleep. I want to think. Water. Give me water.
How's yours?
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
Yes...
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
What's that?
This one , Lance?
You hear it again?
You think he'd of shot us?
I don't think he'd of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board --
Captain Willard?
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Cognac?
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
What will you do after the war?
So that's it.
You came right to it, son of a bitch --
Hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live.  You're the first people we've seen in two weeks.
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
48   CONTINUED:
165  CONTINUED:  
You'll catch a chill by that dumb waiter shaft.  Sit on the cot.  Keep this pointed at him if I get preoccupied.
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
39   CONTINUED:
Oh.
What about you -- why come back? Classy girl like you seems more suited to the finer things.
You should know something.
What happened here?
Where'd you say Eric is?
What about that hotheaded marshal, Sam Wilder?  I heard he was in the middle of this mess.
He's coming around fine.
Did you catch Corbett?
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
That's not what I meant.
Where's Corbett?
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Ben Corbett?
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
How the hell were they smart enough to find us?
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?
We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
Have to get these wet things off.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
You were real resourceful out there.  Got me thinking of this perimeter man, froze all his fingers one winter.  So he hacked the tips off and sharpened the exposed bones.  Gets along better than ever.  Yeah, maybe I underestimated you.
How come you didn't let him shoot me?
Look down there, tell me what any of this matters.  Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth.  I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
You better get some sleep.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
Will you rent me a cabin, or not?
You don't mind me saying, Mr. Desmond, you look like hell.
What's wrong?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
I'm too old for this shit.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
I didn't know you had a secret admire.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
Call me as soon as you're settled.
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
How long has he been having problems?
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
I know. He's just the best.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
Spencer.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
What about your mother?
What needs clearing up?
I'm not kidding.
So. Anything else?
The stiff one eye?
Hi.
Thanks, Melvin.
Hey -- you let him...
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?
How you doing?
Cute.
What job?
Well...
Can you not be violent?
How to die, mostly.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
One night with me!
I love you...  Let him take you home.
You changed the room around...
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
No touch. No touch. No touch.
You're taking him...  yes...  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try...  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
Terrify me?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
No, I didn't.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
I think you gotta camp it here...
So you're practically finished, huh?
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Why are you doing this?
What?
Where you from?
Okay.
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
What does that fucking mean?
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
Five million dollars?
I'm on the scent.
How in the fuck do you know that?
What?
Hello, Robert.
I know what happened.
You think this is a fucking joke?
Um, five.
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
I work for the government.
Okay.  How did you find me?
What does that mean?
Someone hired both of you?
So this is something between you and him?
He wants to kill you?
Yeah.
Because I'm done.
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
No.  I graduated from George Washington University.  Then I entered the Agency training program.
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
Women?  No... not really.
Women... I don't... I don't want to talk about women.
Because you are a women.
They become complicated... messy.
Do you have a passport?
That's where he'll be.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Then, we wait.
I told you, he will.
Yes.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
Ten years later, here you are again.
They're worth less points.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
What are you doing?
Why?  I don't know.
What happened to her?
I waited another four minutes.
Wait until he is on the stairs.
I'm taking off my mike.
Thank you.
I know this may seem like a strange question, but can I ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, I know you're a professional, but just for me, I was just wondering.
What are you thinking about?
Can I ask you a question?
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
You wish to close this account today?
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
How to make a buck!
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
Who's your friend?
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
Tell them we're working for the University.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
I'm an idiot?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
Yeah, her name's Kavlova, why?
I thought you were gonna throw these?
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Afternoon!
Like a hand?
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
Don't tell me you really are in love?
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
Huh?
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
And if you're wrong.
It's...42 56 76 .
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
God, I think I need a holiday.
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
I made a deal with Josh.
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
It's that one isn't it.
Good morning.
Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Before you go, did you get those bruises here?
I've been around.
Turned Czech huh?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
Doug I can't, I've got to be at work by eight. You promised to take me home.
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
Will it help to get you out?
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
You mean it's started?
I thought I'd help out.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
Seems a shame!
Shall I wash these out?
Did you take your things over to my place?
This is your doing?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Really!
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
What is it you want?
I'm not sure it's possible.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
Would you like your things now?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
We had a deal!
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
When the hell did you write that?
Josh!
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
It could help with a new car --
You look nice. I should have dressed.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
A late night or an early morning?
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
I told him to leave me alone.
Hypotheticals --
Don't call him a dipshit.
Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real.
Get yourself a glass.
Because, growing up, books were my world.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
I know you don't want help.
I'll take a chance.
I know. Don't say anything.
Saturn. Beautiful.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
Yeah.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
He doesn't trust you.
You're not in a very good mood.
You were great the other night.
I don't want to be just your friend --
So you're talking to me?
Excuse me?
What do you actually know with religion?
Assholes. This happen to you?
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
One of your secrets.
You're worried about your college applications.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here.  I could start by driving her to school --
But if you could, you would?
By accident --
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
You're in the play?
How about your family?
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
Landon. You go on home.
I thought she built it herself.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
Morning Dick.
Learn anything?
It's polyester.
Huh?
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
George, she's beautiful, right? She's nice, she's decent, she's the kind of girl you'd like to marry, right? And there's nothing in the world you'd like more than to take her to that dance, right?
What is that? A pencil that writes in ink?
Your line, George!
You know damn well that's not what I meant.
Yeah, explode it up your ass!
You have a name?
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
A time machine! Because of that Coke?!
Professor, you time machine works! It works! It sent me back in time! I'm from 1982!
You answered the door!
I am serious. If we could get you, the time machine, and the power converter in the vicinity of an atomic blast, we could send you back to the future.
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
That's all taken care of.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?
Hi. where's Cato?
Catch!
What'd they look like?
You lost that one?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Then why'd you do it?
What do you think you're doing? Go on, get out of here.
Can I be honest?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
You want to go for a ride?
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Somebody else is going to get it.
Is that all there is to it?
You know what I think?
Look at all this junk.
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
Everybody loves trout.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
Have you got a better idea?
Hi.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Who are you?
Okay, friend. Start running.
Hi.
You tossed my hat out the window.
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New Jersey on the exact same date.
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
There's another one we owe 'em.
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...
Planet 10?
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
Apache?
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
And they got Penny!  Look!
Go away.  Let me rot?
You keep an eye on it.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the Earth's caught in a crossfire.
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?
But John Whorfin said kill her.
What's happening with my call to SAC?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
It's a spittin' image.
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
Let him go.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
So now I'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
I write.
No, I  I didn't mean to sound 
Yeah, he's funny that way.
I don't know exactly. But I do know what you're doing with that drink. You're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and Audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
On the Beery picture! Where are we? Wuddya got?
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
I don't understand-
...Look, they love you, kid  everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
Go ahead, son.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that 
... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
What kind of scribbler are you  newspaperman did you say?
...Is the egg showing or what?!
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
...And look, I'm sorry as hell about the interruption. Too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
...What's the expression  me myself and I.
Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself 
It's okay, it's okay.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Get a grip on yourself, brother. Whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
...I just don't know what... to do
...Don't look at me like that, neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side...
I  Mr. Lipnik 
Mr. Lipnik, I 
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
...I was commissioned yesterday in the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau arranged it. He's a dear friend.
...Are you a tranz or a rez?
...Yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Big fuckin' deal.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
He teach you to do it?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
We got a treatment on it yet?
Yes, Colonel.
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
There's no smoking in this building.
We were in some of the same classes.
Who?
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
Were you with him last night?
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
Even though you were fucking him.
I passed.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
You tell me.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
Why not?
Ice?
Aren't you going to thank me?
Why take the risk?
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
You're in over your head.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
About three months before I met you.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
How'd you get in here?
I'm writing a book.
I'm John Corrigan.  I'm an assistant district attorney, Ms.  Tramell. Can we get you anything?  Would you like some coffee?
I had another one of you guys down here from Frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  What's this about anyway?
Was she ever a suspect?
He had a girlfriend?
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
Why not?
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
He ain't that way.  He's got heart.
Homicide.
Were you with him last night?
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
So what do we do -- nothing?
She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Fuck you, Phil.
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
Why do you think he's dead?
Naa..
New York.
Ouch..
Piss painting?
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
After the show we should take a nice long vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. I wanna sing.
These are great.
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
What do you mean?
I hear your show was sold out already. There's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Yes. What do they... stand for?
What are they?
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here  I made this for you.
What're you doing? You're doing something.
What's the rush, John Henry?
What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
That's not how I meant it.  For all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!
Guess I just got sick of him.
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
You do! You definitely do.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Wanna go get some breakfast?
You're back.
... babies.
Hi.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
So shut up and keep painting..
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
Where's the fire?
How could you?  I'm a woman...
As I was saying:  I'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  Are you listening, you Batman you?
A "he-man"?  Sure.  They shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole I crawl out of.
Hey stud:  I thought we had something together.
Admiring your handiwork?
What're you really after?
We've met.
I'm listed.
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You almost sound enthusiastic.
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
... What do we do?
No.  No glass on the inside.
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Son!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
You buy this "blurry" business?
Ten, nine...
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
I don't.  So, no.
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Alfred, if I've never told you...I just want to say...
I've spent my whole life trying to beat back death.  What good are all my heroics now if I can't save you?
It's good to see you.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Al's main squeeze.  Is she here?  I'm about to scrape the bottom of my shoe off my tongue, right?
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Youwsa!  Nothing but air.
You're loosing your cool
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
How did you...?
She's still alive.  He's adapted his freezing technology to reverse McGregor's Syndrome.  He's even found a cure for the early stages of the disease.
No beauty...
We gotta get those locks changed.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
No sign of the snowman.
They're overly protective.  You're Not going to hurt me are you, Ms...
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
Tell me, billionaire, would you warm faster to my pleas if I looked more like Ms. January here?
You're not even listening to me.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
That's gotta hurt.
What happened to his wife?
He needs extreme cold to survive. His cryo-suit uses diamond enhanced lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Like hell you do.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
You have to tell me what you're doing with my Venom.
The dreams again, sir?
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
Maybe they're right.
She's the first woman in a long time that's... No. She's the first woman ever. And she loves Batman. Not Bruce Wayne. If I let go of Batman I'll lose her.
Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
...Afraid.
What do maniacs always want?
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
Why's that?
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
We all wear masks.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Rinka.
Psychiatrists make you nervous?
I think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
To kill me.
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Why do you do that?
In a sense we are all two people. The side we show in daylight. And that side we keep in shadow.
My parents are laid out in the library. Their skin smells like talcum powder. I'm so small. My father's diary is on his desk like always. I'm opening the book. Reading. I'm running out into the storm. The book is in my hands. I can't hear my screams over the rain. I'm falling...
I don't-.
...Not the bat?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
Sure, E = MC squared. Until you factor in more than three dimensions. Then... Damn. Hit us again.
Go ahead. You can say it.
We want to dust him. We truly want to dust him bad.
A-14.
B-12.
Where's the boy?
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
What about the girl?
How much do you weigh?
... How long have I been out?
How'd you find this place?
Great.  Give me a grant.
No.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
My brother's a priest, man.
I understand.
It's not the girl, Jack.  Sooner or later you would've tried to take me.  You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
Joker here. Can we talk?
And you want a --
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Burned out.  I need a vacation.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Are they paying you for all this?
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Alexander... I know you.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
Not what?
Couldn't turn down the job, huh? A girl could get hurt this way.
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
Do we know anything about him?
Jesus.
Let's get a coffee.
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Oh Jesus.  Oh God.  Oh Jesus God.  Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh Jesus of Nazareth.
What happened?!!!
Howls he getting on with the family?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
Okay, that'll do.  The Governor's here in half an hour.  We have to be totally ready then.  No excuses.  Period!
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?
You're not going to ....
Thank you David.  However, flattery will get you nowhere.  Truth is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.  Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
Welsh.
Welsh again.
... in the distant future.
what a pleasure, Governor.  Welcome.
off the peg?
Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
Damn, huh huh.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Dammit, all they have is shows about water.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Ow! I'll kick your butt!
Uh...
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
...Two...
Talk ta me, Bork.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
They look like a couple of kids chief.
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Cavity search...?
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
You scored with two chicks?!
You got two seconds!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
She's ready.
Wave at the lion.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
What?
I don't think we survived the crash.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
We're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
I feel really stupid.
Has anything been simple so far? From the look of the shovel, we dig.
What time is it?
A... Are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
What?
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
Did you get the paint?
You don't have an appointment, do you?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
Handbook?  When...?
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at your service.  You be the judge. I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.
-- Like you used to be?
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you. I heard you were on vacation!
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Beetle!
I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?
Can you help <u>me</u>?
Your qu...?  But you're...
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
Just don't tell Lydia.
They're probably guilty about what they did to me.
What do you think, honey?
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
What?
Darling, can't you see I'm relaxing in here!
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Stepmother's...
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
Okay?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
You don't have a key?
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your ghosts.
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
They don't want to come down.
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
I swear, Chauncey, between you and Benjamin, I've got my hands full...  ... Say, that is coming along, the swelling has gone down considerably...  ... Any pain here?
... Oh? You've heard?
I would like to walk today.
Will you be leaving now, Robert?
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Would you care to take it, sir?
Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
I would like to watch television.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Did you lose something?
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
I see. Then one more quick question, Mr. Gardiner; since we at the Post would like to, uh - update our profile on you - what exactly is your business?
Do you realize, Mr. Gardiner, that more people will be watching you tonight than all those who have seen theater plays in the last forty years?
Regretfully, Mrs. Rand - I shall yield the pleasure of your company to others.
I feel very good in here.
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
No, Ben.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Certainly, Ben.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Ronald Stiegler, of Harvard Books.
Of course, who can nowadays? I have trouble writing a post card to my children! Look, we could give you a six figure advance, provide you with the very best ghostwriter, research assistants, proof readers...
May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
Let's have a look, do you mind?
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
... I see.
Well, ain't that the truth...
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
I know that, Mr. Gardiner.
... Are you waiting for someone? An appointment?
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
How were you paid?
Those trees were very young when I first arrived.
... Do you drive this, Mr. Chance?
Mr. Chance, assuming what you say is the truth, I would like to know what sort of claim you are planning to make against the deceased's estate.
Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
... In the garden?
Yes. It has.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
I can certainly understand that...
No! He's a real gardener!
Good night.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Well, Ben... I...
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
John! Great to see you! Sorry about the cunt at reception.
Malkovich.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Did you eat?
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
How was it?
So how was it? What was he doing?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
Don't forget me.
Maxine...
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
Please have a seat, Mr. Juarez...
Security.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
No.
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
Dr. Lester. . .
Dr. Lester...
Yes, well...
Yeah.
Who told you?
Somebody told you.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
Tickets to Malkovich?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're late.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
Lotte? Is that you?
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
No.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
Forget it.
Do you dream often?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
We have to meet.
How do we do that?
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Is there dancing?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
You still there, sweets?
Vegas.
I am not a child, Captain Mertin, but rather an adult lady of miniature proportions.
There ain't.
Folks came.
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
But you got to do it. You got to. Can't nobody Call like you. You have to be there.
You punishing Him, ain't you?
You still know.
YOU HURT ME.
What do you know about it? I sleep where I want.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
That girl...You know, Beloved...
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
You grown.
Well, good luck with the job.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
They good whitefolks?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
Back stiff?
Should I wake her?
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
No...no...no..
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
It's her, ain't it?
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
Jesus.
Leave off..
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
Look here..There's a cross up there, so I guess this here's a church or used to be. Seems to me like you ought to show it some respect, you follow me?
Yeah?
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
He peed on the Dude's rug--
I am the Walrus.
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
It's already posted.
What do you need that for, Dude?
Those are good burgers, Walter.
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.  Or the Creedence tapes.
Ahh, not so good, man.
Which one was Logjammin'?
I've heard the kidnapping story, so save it.  I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude, and I don't care what you're trying to take off her husband.  That's your business.  All I'm saying is, I want mine.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Oh yeah?
You mean coitus?
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
Yeah, but what about--
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
She most certainly was not!
She is most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.
Well...yeah--
Not the compromised second draft. And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the Seattle Seven?
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
Well...no, of course not--
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--
So...that doctor.
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about?! This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.  Across this line you do not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- American.  Please.
What the fuck are you--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
Huh.
That...fucking...bitch!
What the hell is this?
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
What the fuck?
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used to say.
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
Thanks Walter.
That makes me feel all warm inside.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Is this your homework, Larry?
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
Huh?
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Oh, shit.
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
It's a heart attack.
We're scattering the fucking ashes!
You make everything a fucking travesty!
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Huh?
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
Oh, shit.
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Blade.
It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
Why do you hate us so much?
It means "bloodbrother."
How does it look?
What do you really think?
I thought you were supposed to be watching our backs.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
And so will we.
It has been said, you may have enemies whom you hate, but not enemies whom you despise.  Be proud of your enemy: then his success shall be yours, too.  In that regard, I should thank you.
And why is that?
Kiss your ass goodbye, Reinhardt.
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
His name is Jared Nomak.
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Tell me something, Skid --
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
This whole deal's giving me a serious case of the butt-willies.
Whistler!
Going somewhere?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  "And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood."
-- he's a vampire.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
You used me as bait?!
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.
Graffiti --
So many of them -- I still can't believe they're real.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
You don't look so good.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
Get out of here --
-- tearing me -- apart.
How's it going, Kam?
How could you be a part of this?
The red blood cells are biconvex, which is theoretically impossible. They're hypochromic, there's virtually no hemoglobin in them.  Look at the PMNs, they're binucleated, they should be mononucleated.
Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed.
The shadows suit us, Frost. We've existed this way for thousands of years. Who are you to challenge our ways?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
LaMagra --
You're a monster.
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
Why do you hunt them?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
What do you mean?
Not that I can see.
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Something was wrong.
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
So says her website.
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
You want me to scooch over next to you?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a <u>chance</u>?
What'd you dream?
I don't know what it is, but there is something <u>happening</u> here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just <u>not</u> going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come <u>with</u> me.
I want to see something!
--like you hurt the baby--
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
So lemme see it.
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What I never could figure about the movie?
No fucking.
Where <u>is</u> it?
Fire escape??
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
Yeah. Me too.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
Be it still alive, James?
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
<u>What</u>?
How're the cameras doing?
Let's get inside.
Running a junk yard.
What--
Just hold on!
Pointless.
What?
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
Women miscarry all the--
What's that?
What'd you see?
For a blur?
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?
We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
I should check on Anna.
She's far from "fine."
It's <u>possible</u> for chrissake--
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Good morning, Sheriff's Office.
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Thanks, Meurice.
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
...I mean, I don't know where he is, but he ain't dead.
...Drive me to a motel?
I could've sworn I heard something.
Uh-huh.
Hello?
Ray?... What time is it?
...You all right?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...What?
...I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.
Well... what happened?
...That's what's important.
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
...But first I gotta know what happened.
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
...What was that back there?
...You get a refund though, if you tell me who else she's been sluicing.
What did you take these for?
Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
So, uh... this wouldn't interest you.
Yeah...
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
...it's too damn risky.
...Count it if you want.
What's this?
Howdy stranger.
Is Marty here?
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Frank. Come in.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Jeffrey?
I guess you've seen some bad things.
Why do you do it?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Is Sandy part of this?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
Yes? What is it?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
What do you want from me?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
Yes.
I made it go down the toilet.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
Oh shit.
Who is Don?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Yes.
No. I should go.
Come in.
It used to make me laugh .but.
What do you want to do?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Oh no.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Hold me, Don.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
No thanks.
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes. pour the fuckin' beer.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Are you alright?
You really want to do this, don't you?
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
Okay. yeah, call.
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
What's with Mike?
You want a Dairy Queen?
Yeah?
Okay. okay.
You were late.
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Yeah.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Really?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Probably not. no. Why?
Are you feeling okay?
Well. Okay.
Yeah?
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Would you like a piece of cake?
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
No honey, I'm alright.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Tuna, this is crap.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
The coca is my responsibility!
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
What can I do for you guys?
What the fuck is that?
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
What did I tell you?
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
What's that?
Twenty-six months.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
What type of planes do you have?
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Diego Delgado, please?
But you must.  It's the only way.
Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each suitcase.  You receive a hundred thousand dollars upon delivery.
Touche.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
I love you, my brother, do you know that?
Take it easy!  Everything's okay!
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
I did not.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Surprised to see me?
Barbara.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
The man in the garden.  He was full of courage.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
I want money.
Yeah, maybe.
Money.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
You mad at me?
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
Hi.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.
Tell Mom, you know...
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
How are you doing, George?
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
Source?  What about Derek?
Jesus Christ.
No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
But this is...
Alright.
What do you want?
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
Well, here I am.  See?
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to...
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we start?
Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine. Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A hundred and twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Look around. I've put everything at your disposal. Go take a look with your own eyes.
It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ...
The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
Second name.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
Of course. As soon as possible.
Can you read?
Where's Kader?
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
It's clear. They'll do everything possible to make it fail.
No, and neither were my men.
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
To show them to the UN, right?
Where were we?
Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thbes?
And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers everything should be over.
Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the only country in the world ...
Okay. But we want your promise for a fair trial in writing. Give us a written statement, Mathieu, and then we'll surrender.
Are you ready, colonel?
You did a good job, Charlie.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
So she knew about his heart?
I think I'm going to make your day.
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?
What can we prove?
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Then how did it get into his body?
Did they argue the day before he died?
Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use cocaine?
C'mon -- think about it.  If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
She's innocent.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
Tell the court about that, please.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Just one last question.  What does the sign on your office door say?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
What happened after that?
Where did you meet Miss Lawson?
Did you ever see her again after that?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Why does she come to you?
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
I heard him say it.
No.
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
Where did you meet him?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
Did he make your life miserable?
What did he say?
What happened next?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Yes.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
I've been to a few -- yes.
Yes.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
Yes.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
Yes.
Something like that.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
Why not?
-- And then?
This is your house.
Why not?
Nothing.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Sugar or honey?
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
You killed him -- didn't you?
She's right, Paley.  You've got to kill me.  She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're an accessory to murder.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
Objection.  The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
Can't it wait?
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
What's she like?
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
I know.
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore.  I don't know me anymore.
It's more involved than that.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Did Marsh use it?
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
How bizarre!
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
What?!
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Nobody did.
Carolyn!
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to Michigan.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
Roseman Bridge?
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Pretty country.
Are you from Washington originally?
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Is the dizziness gone?
You ought to write these stories down.
Why did you stop?
My God. How I'd love to see that.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
When?
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
So what happened?
You must get lonely at times.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
But it's not the same.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
I bet you could do a book.
Where was she?
Sleep all right?
What are you doing?
How do you know what I experience?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
I don't know. Please...
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
You feeling better Franny?
'Bout 4:30.
Where you going?
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Hell no!
We practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
'S up?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Damn.  That is the ugliest building I have ever seen.
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Those 'fools' are my people.
Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
Gotta be an in-ey and gotta be smooth. If it's ragged, it was picked too soon. Won't ever be ripe.  Second, it's got to have just a little give, here.  At the edges.  And last, but not very far from least...  You gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
Jimmy, you've got --
I want you to do something for me, baby.
Where are we, baby?
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
I don't understand it.  You were my Man. Since we was grasshoppas.  I always looked after you.  You had a piece of everything I had.
I lied.
In his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  Covered with blood.
Are they on the radio?
Like right now, there's actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  Fingers rotting off?
Lucky thing.
I'm here.
Patrick, he's...
We gotta jump!
Where is it?
Where are we going?  You know I hate surprises.
What are we doing down here?
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
What the hell do you want?
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
I just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
And some people need their medication tweaked.
Not really to live, just to play.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
Illibent?  Who's club is that?
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making too much noise.
Where is this going, Johnnie?
The next one blows off your dick.
Caesar?  What is this?
So, you just got out?
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
You mean they weren't up here?
It couldn't have been.
Got to think this through ...
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
You can't leave.
All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Shut up, Violet!
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
You're helping Rajeev?
Where is it?
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
We was worried about you, Cease.
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
You got the key?
Hello?
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
Truck.
'63 Chevy.
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Curious, maybe.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
I had to see you.
What are you afraid of?
I don't.
Yes.
Caesar lives for these moments.  He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that.  He likes it.  The violence.  I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  He says they remind him who he his.  They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
What?
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Any bodyguards?
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
I'm just asking, what if?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
He'll have to run.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
It's me.
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
Oh, God.
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
No.  We can't risk it.
I know you've been trying to kill me.
I don't think so.
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
D'accord...  Merci.  Un moment -- un moment --
His brother.  You know his brother?
Mr. Kane...  Come right in...please...have a seat.
Look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  I'm assuming you're still in the market.  It's the same vessel?
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
You could buy a car for twenty grand.  You could buy this car.
What if I say no?
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.
And you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
What are you talking about?
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
Four-fifty.  That's the address...
I trusted you.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
Oh, Jesus...
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
Who is it?
Yes.
You have ID?
Get in the basement.
Wait a minute --
What?
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
What?
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
...ervices.
...Be back.
...ergency procedures.
You telephone, sir.
Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
Oh yeh? Where'd you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
Sign the form so we can get to it.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
If I can help you ...
Help me!
Please, I've got to find Jill.
What's the matter?
You are late.
You clever bastard! I might have guessed. You only moved in today and you're already hot on the bloody trail.
Please, Sam, we're going to have to be open to each other on this one. If you make a reputation with this case, it'll be at my expense.
Enough though, eh?
Christ! You do know it all!
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
They weren't at school with us.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
It could all be coincidental.
Yes we have, Jack!
Jack?... Jack?
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
Where do I get it stamped?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
You think these are tits don't you?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Where are you taking me?
What's going on here?
Who is this war against, Sam?
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Yes ... but, this is real. Now, stop! 
Turn!
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
Isn't it? Whose is it?
It's your mother isn't it? Pulling strings again.
Damn! Blast!
What! Shit!
You want to take my console into your office?
I know her age and distinguishing marks. But I need an address or a place of work or something
Sod it, it's broken!
Oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise. 
It's a refund ... I'm afraid there was a mistake.
Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
That's all right Ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. To him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
Put the phone down and your hands up.
But we can get one.
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
You're killing me, you know that? You got no sick time according to Command. I've been told to terminate.
I've never fired anyone in my life.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
I feel for you, but we got an emergency here. It's a weekend of full moons.  Everyone's called in sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too. We need bodies out there. I had to put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know he's not supposed to work two nights in a row.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
No, no, that's impossible.
Is she dying?
Be cool, man. You're having a paradoxical reaction. It can happen.  Didn't I tell you this guy was stressed out?
Does that hurt?
What about Kanita?
See, I can't do it. I came out of the desert.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
Did you see my father?
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
You married?
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.
Five years.
I think I'd remember that.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
Promise you won't go inside.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
She only works when I'm on. I make her wait and it drives her crazy.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
Three legs.
I'll drink to that.
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
These are hard times, Tom.
Great to be drunk. Sobriety's killing me.
Mr. Oh.
Whadda we bring?
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
This guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. The term "menace to society" was made up for him.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
Oh no!--I just remembered.
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
Well why didn't you say so?
Larry, swing over on Eighth. We're gonna hafta run one of these calls.
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
What did I do to you?
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world.  It's unseemly.
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
I don't like being handled.
No.  No.
What did they do with you?
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
I don't think so.
This story they won't cover.  And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
He excels at gratitude.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
Okay.  Let's do me.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
I write for you sometimes.
What happened?
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
Did you bring your grey suit?
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite.  I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
How'd it go?
No.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday.  Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
We came from Washington.
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
It's Aaron.
Because...
Yes.  That's right.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
You know, Tom, I feel a little proud when people comment on your looks.  Maybe you should feel that way.
As long as that's your only problem you're...
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
Hi.
If we could just eat first.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
So you like me, huh?
It's incredible who's here.
Why can't I let go of this woman?
At least kiss me when you do that.
What?
Hi.  It's me.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
Then give me a minute...
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
Are you okay?
Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
Would you like to do me?
Are you nervous, Walter?
It's just an innocent question.  Besides I just wanted to clarify your intentions.
What did he do?
See you later -
Where where...
Uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, Walter?
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Would you really like to?  That would make me very happy.
Here you go, enjoy.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Yeah, can you say plagiarism?
I wonder what his deal is.
Man this is heavy!
Man, why do you suppose Walter wants to get her alone?  You suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
That's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
You...made that?
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
All that is comes through the eye of the artist...
People seem to like my cat.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
It's hot in here...
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
I was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
It's like...you've turned on.
I don't think so Mayolia.
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
T-tell him that?
What's all the noise in here!
Walter have you been talking to yourself again?
What's wrong with you!?!
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Nice to feel needed.
Buffy!  Looking tasty.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Which way did she go?
Are there any good sicknesses that aren't too depressing?
Hi, Buffy.
You okay?
Hey there.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
You broke up with my machine?
Ah, my fool is dead.  He was careless, always.  Still, I'll pull out your tongue for that.  Don't you understand?  I've killed you a dozen times.  Your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  I have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  A thousand years, and more. I have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and I have bathed in the blood of emperors.
You're even weaker than the others.
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
I am a God!  A God!
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
You sure?
Hey, Buffy...
I didn't expect to see you.
Come again?
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Leave me alone.
I'm going out the front.
Good thing one of us was prepared.
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
Can't.  History report.  The Normans and the Saxons.
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
Totally stale.  And the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  We're thinking Pavilion.  Sitch?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Listen to you.  What language are you speaking?
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
What are you talking about?
Why?
Chosen to go to the graveyard?  Why don't you just take the first runner up, okay?
I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar.  And I... was fighting.  I'm always fighting. And there's a guy...  He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
How do you know all this?
None of your business.  God.
All right.  What do we do now?
What?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
But you threw a knife at my head!
It was necessary.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
Nice conversationalist!  Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
You are such a wet.
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Pike.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
Hi, guys.
Why?  Why me?
Bessel!  What are you doing here?
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Buffy!
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Buffy, the ape-woman.
What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
No...  You want me to give him a message?
You said "Crash".
Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
The right nostril.  Good.
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
We lost.
It's Skip, for you.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
She's dancing with me.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Damn.
Your place or mine?
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
He' s confused--
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
And now you wanta teach me?
I doubt that.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
I got released.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Don't bump me.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
You missed the tag!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Fastball.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
What do I gotta do?
What's wrong?
You're a great catcher.
Sorry about last night.
I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
No way.
Little high.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Eight and twenty-four.
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
Well, I'd rather not say.
Goddamn, that's great!  Jesus!  Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but--  Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown.  To Sandy's...  the whorehouse.
Look at yours.
That's right.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year.
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
...been right, but who knows?
Okay, Randy. Thank you.
Hello.
...listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger. I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.
Now this is just a signature card.
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
Amy! Amy, open the door!
Mommy.
...give him a shot at runnin' a casino and he tries to talk you out of it.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
I'll take Columbia for twenty.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
I'm - I'm hearin' things from security. They're all ex-cops. The Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. They want to put you in the Black Book.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
Hey, Ace.
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
...okay? I just wanna run a square joint. That's it. I just want my license. I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.
That's all taken out of context. Okay.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
You lost your control.
Listen, I would -
...don't do it to me...
Okay?
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
What - what, Caesar's?
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
...uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
No problem.  Sorry.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Okay. You come by the house?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
Any change?
She took care of the dealers...
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Why do you need that much?
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that?
You didn't have to beat him up!
It's okay.  Look...  ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
Right.
...the rest of the two million is still there?
With the money.
You're lower than a dog!
Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 9 a.m. Be there!
Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.
With Jennifer.
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
Get - Get up! Get up!
You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
I am not!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
If she calms down, I will let her in the house.
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
...and hypocrisy.
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
Well...
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
Well, I... I never tried.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Look what they did to my hand, man!
Yeah.
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
You gotta go back out there.
Yeah, that works out.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
What do you want? It - It's pitch- black out here. It's tin foil.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.
Artie!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
Of course, Remo.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
Uh-huh. Good.
Tell me.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
No, he's not.
Yeah.
What did I tell you? Supposing he goes back home and makes a fuckin' beef?  I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me what you said to him.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
...same outfit.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
Well, how 'bout that?
All right.
I'm here.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
Do you know that?
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?
...all the luck in the world.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
We'll go later.
He was just on the phone.
He's sittin' by the phone -
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
...they're in Penthouse K.
They checked in alone.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Hey, how you doin'? 
Incredible.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Yeah.
Smarten up.
...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come here. Come here. Get him up. Come here.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
And this is Stacy.
This is Nick.
Sue me, you Jew fuck!
You must have drunk too much.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
I know. I know.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
Don't know.
Calm down, calm down. Shh!
Whoa. Calm down.
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Tony.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Have we reached the epi-center?
Strange--you seemed so close. I wonder what's happened since yesterday..
What's the matter...
How heroic of you...
I'm sorry I went off like that, I get passionate. I--I guess I'm a passionate person. One of those things I had forgotten.  When you were a little boy did you want to grow up to be a superhero?
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
Quite a pair we make. Thank you, Jeff.
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
Women, huh?
You're kidding.
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Don't you feel so much better now that you know everything?  Blink once for yes, twice for..
"Dat's gotta hurt!"
What's the catch?
God-damn..
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
Well, you don't see that everyday. Somebody tell me what's the deal with Frida Kahlo here?
You like them, don't you, Boss.
I loved you.
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
How can you say things with such feeling and then turn around and put on a helmet and...Who are you?  Were you sitting on my right or my left at the card table?  Tell me!  Please tell me who you are; you own me that!
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
You're late. I've got some good news and some good news. I'm giving you more hours and the new uniforms came in.
I don't know what came over me.
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
I'm afraid last night was the last straw of our city's tourists. The Mayor, in his finite wisdom, is throwing a "Month of the Woman" luncheon ball for the public this afternoon to try and calm everyone down. I thought maybe you and I could...
Okay, deal.
You're late.
Mom?  Oh Mom, I messed up...
I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
You seem sad, Spooky.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.
I know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
You gotta just look the other way.
It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
Lady, don't let him do it!
Nels reporting in.  Sit down where you are.  Arms folded.
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
And stop with the directions.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
Any minute.
No.  <u>You</u> don't understand!  You caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  And I've got no time to screw around.
Lady, try making some sense.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Where'd they take you to?
Please.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
I'm with two friends now.
What do they need her for?
Why isn't anyone answering me?
Tell me what she looks like.
Hey drop it, okay?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
What bank?
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Not a chance.
Do you know what's in that box?
You can't give up.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
God, if he doesn't come back --
Can you walk?
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
Once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
It's locked.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
He had a gun.  I have it now.
At least one.
You timed that beautifully.
Nobody's easier to con than a con man.
Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
They'll have units blocking us up ahead.
Which one of us is elected to do the deed?
I'm handling it.
Some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
Who are you working for?
Twenty percent.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
What time frame have you got in mind?
You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
Satisfied?
It's in the process.
You should've done all this before.
And not a nickel.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
Seems like it.
Yeah.  Why don't we?
Who am I talking to?
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
Who's this?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
Why are you picking on me for?
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
See, they get the wrong idea.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
No.
You all right?
Give me that look again.
He lived here with you?
He was different.
No.
You want to know how I kissed him?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
You mean that?
Drink.
Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
Never let the sun go down on an argument, Jody used to say.
You're something else, Dil, you know that?
You could?
Kind of liked you as a girl.
Details, baby, details.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Should have stayed a girl.
She own you, Jimmy?
She from Scotland too?
What you doing, Jimmy?
You'd do anything for me?
You promise?
You want to make me look like him...
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Come on...
You got to forget you ever saw me, Dil.
You tried.
You like me now, Jimmy?
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
More endearments.
Love me.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
She was --
Yes. Now.
Where am I to go, Jimmy?
See does he want some.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Eddie and Tinker died.
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
So he knows your name?
Back in a minute, Jody
I thought it was Dave.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Eat something, would you?
This is a farce, man.
Please, man, I'm suffocating in here.
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
I'm not a gambling man.
Why can't we?
Shut the fuck up, would you?
Didn't look like that to me...
It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Now put it back in.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
We don't look on it like that.
Go to sleep now.
When I was a child...
Not a lot of use, are you, Fergus?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
I'm glad you're doing it, do you know that, Fergus?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
I said you bastard -- stop --
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my mama didn't raise no stupid children. I know who's got the money 'n I ain't disappearing till I got my share -- 'n' my share's growin' a whole lot bigger ev'ry day.
Oh, come on!
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
Oh!
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Reggie -- please believe me!
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
And I'm afraid we want it back.
No, what?
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
That's the spirit.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
No.
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
What's your first name today?
But you're -- divorced?
What now?
Sorry about that.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
Scobie?
Sure.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Whitefoot, of course.
What are you doing?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
No sense messing up the streets.
Yes, I know.
Reggie -- open the door.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
No -- not yet.
Are you going to listen?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful?
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
I was, too.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- !  What's that?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Peter Joshua.
Oh. I guess.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
I wasn't --
We're here.
On the street where you live.
So they think he left it with you.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
But why do you want a divorce?
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
What's he up to?
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
I don't see him.
Yeah? What's that?
Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
I'm not fucking you. Not for all your CDS.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
Ok.
No honey.
Who is she Daddy?
You were eavesdropping.
We need you here. I can bring her in.
St. Michael's.
No, you couldn't.
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
Please get out of my way or I'll have to hurt you.
You aren't going to the party?
Me? Why me?
Mark Shale.
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Oh nice save.
Kenny'll come running back. This is just his way of pressuring you.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
You heard about that?
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Are you coming to the party?
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Go to the police station!
Mom?
They were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. And she was  a loner. An angry girl that no one really liked. She'd called them 'queers'.
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
Two men left town right after it happened.
Mr. Sisler was one of them.
Yes.
Yes?
On what side of the family?
You ok?
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
On our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. Terminate us instantly. We'd never experience what it means to make love.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Since when does...
Well, he told me to collect cash.
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
Oh.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
I got, uh....
Look, put this in the back.  Keep it safe.
There we go.  There we go.  Did you keep it safe?  Did you 
You gave him ice cream, didn't you?  Come on, let's go.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
That dog ain't mean.
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
You stole this truck! That's...

Shut up.
Oh, shit.
 Nice job back there.
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
...let live.
Oh, shit.
Come on, old...
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
...do we?
 Okay.

Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, shit.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
Whoo!
I made it!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
What the fuck was that?!
Shut up!


Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!
 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
All right, let's go.
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
 Listen!  Listen...
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
He's crazy!
Come on!



This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.

...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  But every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
Nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  My credit was fucked!  And then when he promoted Sam over me, I just snapped.  So I split.
You know, four years ago, I was a split end at Kentucky State.
How wonderful for you.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...
A-And you  owe me...
Bullshit.  You would've killed us anyway.
Listen, Arlo.
Hey, just shut up.
Okay. 

Okay, here we go.
Go!
Stop.
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
Oh, shit.
We!
And Brynner's right on...
Shoot me. 
Mason.
What?
...another way  outta here.    Hey.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
They'll meet you at the top.
Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey.  We are heroes, my man.  It's time to start actin' like it.
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Who put the big hurt on...
You.
...face" crap you've been telling me?
Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
Uh, he handled rackets, and I carried the balls.
Hey.
Be cool.  Be--
 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
I urge you to be persuasive.

It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
So you called the damned thing Elvis
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
We've got it...
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo! 
Yes, sir.
And I changed the schedule.
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...me, if I thought there was any real danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.
No!
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
No, go--
You look fit...healthy...
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
...and the government.
"Went away."  I like that.
All right.  After they put you away...

...maybe even Salt Lake, not to mention Casper...

 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
...comes up that road.
Well.  It appears someone's been lying to us.
Of which we have more than enough.
Hit him again.

Carl, Dennis, get out of sight.
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
....-lene.
Iced coffee.
Quite a getup for jacking...
Actually, I was just looking for a restroom.

Hello.
...the river.
No.
 Two pots of coffee...
Oh, no?

That little geek is my...
Well, I've got Dr. Long's body down at the coroner's office.
A man named Tim Ma-...
...-time. 
My secret?
...is a perfect hunter.
...without caution...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
...you, Mason?
There's a vent shaft leading straight up.
You find yourself wearing a...
...beer.
Get in 

Negative.  Negative.
Look at that.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Well, then, how about a ruler?
But I'm surprised you're still working for her, unless she's suddenly come up with another husband.
If you want an answer to that question I can always put one of my men on the job. Good afternoon, Mr. Cross.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Is she all right?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
...the coroner's report showed Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
They don't kill a guy for that.
Gee, this is a surprise, Mr. Gittes.
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
I'll throw that in too.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
How do you happen to know her?
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?
You really think I'm stupid, don't you, Gittes?
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
I know what he says.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
Where?
Give you three minutes.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mulwray.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.
No.
No.
Would you like something to drink?
That's not his apartment.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
I got your check in the mall.
You'll have to explain that, Mrs. Mulwray.
Yes... why?
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Another satisfied client?
Over the water department, or over you?
Never forgave him for what?
That dam is a con job.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
I'll stay.
Maid's night off?
When was the last time?
What's wrong?
What about it?
And I want to know where.
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
She's too upset.
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Did you get some sleep?
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
That's good. Now what's her name?
That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
Let me handle that.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
The obituary column?
Yeah, Sophie.
Who?
Oh my goodness.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Wait. Please sit down, Mr. Gittes. We're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. As you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. The city comes first, naturally.  But, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. Naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
Speak English?... Habla Ingles?
The water.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
Come again?
It's bone dry, Morty.
Of course not.
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
He owned the water department?
This?
Look, Jake. She gave us Mulwray's real phone number and address.
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
She ran off to Mexico. Rumor was she was knocked up and didn't even know who the father was. Went there to get rid of it.
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...'  You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
So what'd they say?
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
You're still beautiful...
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
Let's hope they like it there.
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Sure, sure.
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
Hello, Mr. Leland.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
I thought it would be a nice gesture - the new publisher -
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Is it good?
The nurse has complete instructions, but if you care to talk to me at any time, I should be only too glad -  I shall be here in the morning.
Let him finish, Charles.
What story, Mr. Rogers?
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
I know it is, Brad -
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
Here I am, darling...  Darling!... Darling, it's all right...  Mother's here.
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Get out, both of you!
Ow!
Toothache.
You're very easily amused.
Thanks.
A rooster?
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan.  Whatever I do -  I do - because I love you.
I won't let you go.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
She doesn't know, Mrs. Kane.  She just sent it - because I made her see it wouldn't be smart for her not to send it.
Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Get Dr. Corey.
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Is Mrs. Kane - 
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
Poor Mr. Carter!
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
They do it only because you do!
I mean I've got a job for you.
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Hello, Brad.
I'll sign those papers -
Well, let's hope it's all for the best.
What's this?
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Yeah, all in crates.
That's the whole works, right up to date.
How did you meet him?
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
What's this?
Beats me.
Fifty-five.
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
That's it, everybody out.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
You can hold me down.
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Dick.
Can I use the bathroom?
Such a sordid state of affair.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
Am I missing something here?
Why?
When did you get back?
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
It's not what you think.
I'm not pregnant.
No.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
Sang.
Promise me it'll always be like that.
I'm serious.
Stop this. This isn't funny.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
With this guy locked in?
Are you open?
This is the last time I come to this place.
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
Awww, he's so cute. What's his name?
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
All right. Jesus, you fuckers are pushy.
Shit!
You win.
In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
I'm talking to myself here.
All four?
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
So they build another Death Star, right?
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.
You'll never believe what this unruly customer just said...
Perfect dozen.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
Nudie booth?
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
The milkmaids.
Thirty-seven!
See? There you go again.
Helluva game!
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Number six.
Shit. What about tomorrow?
You hardly knew her!
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Oh, my god.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
I can't fucking believe you!!
Fine. Just lend me your car.
I want to rent a movie.
Hermaphroditic porn. Starlets with both organs. You should see the box: Beautiful women with dicks that put mine to shame.
You're happy to get a fine?
Wow. You've had quite an evening.
You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
Thirty-seven.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.
How's your eye?
You didn't have to choke me.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Get the fuck outta here already.
I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.
Do I know you?
Are there any balls down there?!
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
Oh... Can I help you?
Actually, it is kind of rough.
The porno mags?
What were you doing up so late?
What were you doing?
What? What is that?
How many girls have you slept with?
You've slept with twelve different girls?
What the hell was that for?
Who?
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
Why do you call him that?
He requested this?
No, but you sucked enough dick!
A few?
Well... why did you have to suck their dicks? Why didn't you just sleep with them, like any decent person?!
I feel sick.
You couldn't get these shutters open?
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
What the fuck did you do that for?
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
It stings a little.
You open?
I'm not out of shape!
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Oh shit, look who it is. The human vacuum.
I think the lady called it.
Really?
I beg your pardon!
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
That's the price, my brother.
And... he told you all of this?
I'm not sad.
Dental School.
Gabe!  Hey, man!  Gabe!  It's Gabe!
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
The money!
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
You don't know anything. You did it your way and she died.
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
What are we going to do?
She's tough.
Please, can I think about this for a minute...Okay, I'm sorry, it's fine.  What do you want me to do?
Please -- oh, no -- please!
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Excuse me?
Did I miss something?
Where?
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
And I can't leave.
I know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  Please Gabe, he went up the west ridge.  If you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
Can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
Gabe...your arm?
A simple yes or no would have done.
Nice view, huh?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Can you see light?
No luck?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
Pull it apart!
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
What do you think?  Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
Just kidding.
Look here, the mountain man. You're Walker, right?
He'll freeze.
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
Then where the fuck is!
You gotta be kidding me!  Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
Right.
I don't know about totally.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Kill me?  Christ we're partners in this!
Don't use my name!
Where's the third one, Travers?
Jessie?  Looks like your friend found company.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
Been punished, yeah?
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
My wife... Alex freezes.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
Help you.
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
So this is the young man?
Hullo.
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
Fine, sir, fine.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em. All three look up startled.
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... hence not at school , yes?
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants to save you from yourself. Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth sounding like ice-cubes.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
I beg your pardon?
Do you feel that way now?
Who said that?
Good.
Good evening, my boy.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
Where is he now, sir?
Helping you, sir?
Well, who can blame them, sir?
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
I'm gonna be sick.
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed. Alex walks to table and undresses. Chief Guard moves to table with his clipboard.
Brown hair, is it?
Blue eyes?
Have you ever had any mental illness?
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise Bog!
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
Stop him! Stop him! A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Moloko-plus.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
How many to a cell?
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
Go ahead, say it.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Like what?
You like being a lawyer?
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Annie...it's Max.
Max, the cab driver!
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
A deer?
The crowd had to dig it.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
I see.  That was an important list, wouldn't you say?  The people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  And you "lost" it?
I picked up a tail.
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
What are you gonna do?
You guys been holding hands?
There was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  Ivan flew out the window and went bam.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
...if they're wrong?!
I was with Max when he got the call.
I'm...in...the...room, here.  Don't talk about me like I'm not in the room.
He's not paying you one cent!
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
Yeah?
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
Why not?
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
We have a deal.  What's your name?
I think he's dead.
Good.  Help me out here.
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
How about the thingy next to it?
I don't know any Rwandans.
Get rid of 'em.
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Show up for what?
You go every night?
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
You get benefits?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
It's what I do for a living.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
<u>I'm</u> full of shit?  You're a monument of bullshit.  You even bullshitted yourself all I am, is taking out the garbage.  Bad guys killing bad guys...
She must be some girl.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
<u>Jerry</u>?  You didn't show last night.  First time ever.  Had me worried, boy.
Saved you last night's, too.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
Not for years.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
What was your horse's name?
I bit the bastard's nose off.
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
People do have heart attacks.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
That was him.
Please put it down.
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
You look great.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
I don't understand.
Did you kill my father?!
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
I believe you.
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
I'm a very patient man.
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
You're here because you figured I might show up.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
And you have no idea where he lives?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
We experimented with hallucinogens.  We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
A dog.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
So, you doing anything tonight?
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
Can I talk to you a second?
What gave me away?
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
I disagree.
Pepsi?  Tequila?
Throw a gray scale on it; standard interpolation.
What?
... Two years is still a hell of a long time -- and as far as we can tell there aren't any provisions in the machine design for storing food, water, even air...
Right.  Well.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
What...
What?
And?
Hydrogen times pi...  Got it.  Strong sucker.
You've only searched -- what is it, sixteen hundred stars without a peep?  Try not to take it too personally.
Okay, let's just slow down.  Pull up the starfield signal origin.
Can't we get rid of them?
Could we hear God?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
Eventually you'll get here on your own.  This was just the first step; in time you'll take another.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
What's that?
What are you talking about?  It's over.
Hokkaido Island.
Why don't you come back with me?
I thought you were here because you want to go.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
But what about your research -- ?
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Did you love him?
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
How do you mean?
What...?
What?
What are you so afraid of?
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
Hi.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
But I made this arrangement --
Buck is a deal.
We call it abuildin' time, Arletta.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Lookit her bounce.
Gotta have kings.
Tell us about it.
Please! Please!
You got your mind right, Luke?
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Here's the Patrol.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
She looks just like Mrs. Patricia Handy, a married woman... I useta fool with. Man, I kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
A cold drink? Okay?
That's my baby.
Man, this here Newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself Luke don't know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
Maybe he's been chain-ganging too long.
Whatta you mean, forget it?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
What you mean, Luke?
Is that your answer, Old Man? You're a hardcase too, ain't you?
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
He peels the eggs himself. That's understood.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
Man! It's gonna be one hot muther today.
Man, it's so hot.
Cuter again.
Man, you play like a kokonut. You got to call him at least.
Man Oh Man.
Stop that.
I don't see no sign of guts in you.
Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
Excuse me, but would you mind explaining why you're watching the lady upstairs?
Now look what you did.
You threatened to drive her downtown.  She has agoraphobia.
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
Oh God.  I'm really crazy.
Cellulite.  What do you say I blindfold you and take you to the gym.  Aerobics with housewives...
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
He was lying.
He took pains to hide his actions because he knew they were morally wrong.  He was not acting on mad impulse.  He was sane and acting out a pattern he carefully followed every time.
The first two murders.
When he was seventeen.
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
Where is it?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Would you want to work with us on this?
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
But it's a different m.o.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
Ruben.
Is that it?
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
You're afraid of him.
Let's speed up the game plan... call all the living serials to ask if they've had contact with a Peter Kurten.  We could use some help on the phones...
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
That computer's wired into INTERNET.
It's gone.  The file's not here.  What did you do?
Don't let go... I can't breathe... I'll die!
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
How come you're so up on Dr. Hudson?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
I like women like that!
You said you don't give a fuck and that's the beauty of a breakdown? This doesn't look like not giving a fuck, you know that?
She didn't fight back, no hair or skin under her fingernails.  I'm not seeing any bruises or contusions...
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
You messed with the scene.
I tagged the goddamned stocking. It ain't lost.  We're sequestering that evidence.  That's the trap some son of a bitch is going to fall into...
We're gonna have a bunch of clapped out old hippies blissing on the Grateful Dead!  Sleeping in the park, smoking dope and sticking tulips up their ass.
I'm <U>telling</u> you.  Don't you <u>ever</u> address me publicly in that tone. You'll work what and <u>who</u> I tell you to work.
So what have we got?
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
Detective Niccoletti?
Put in the Kevin Costner.
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
Is that a gift from Wendel? It has an aeronautical feel to it.
What!? They brought the car here?
Have you seen it?
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
Do you find him attractive?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
I thought that was you, up there.
So - why the airport?
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
What is it?
You're kidding.
I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
I need to see you, Ballard. I need to talk to you about the project.
Patient.
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
What's up with you?
Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
What about this one?
You're slowing.
Are you sure, Dear?
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Ruth's already taken him home.
I'll see you soon.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
Honestly, Letty.
If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Don't take it personally.
What are you looking to read?
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
I wish I could have seen that.
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
I love the pillows.
Hey.
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
How may I help you?
Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
Aunt Lily?
Something like that.
What do you mean not taking your meds?
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
But what about that math project?
Are you all right?
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
All tapped out.
How's it look?
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
Zero.   That's all I know.
Who?
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
Yeah.   We just go home.
Forget the money! We've got bigger problems than the money right now.
Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!
Do they come with batteries?
I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's house.
We still have to get out of here.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
Hadley --
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
Anybody hungry?
Did you have to use that much explosive?
I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
Don't bullshit me.
I've got a way with people.
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.
Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.
What room number?
They don't have a wine list.
I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
You lived there. You know the city.
-- I want to be Elvis.
Give it to me, Sami.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
What happened?
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
I think we went the wrong way.
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
You put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? How stupid is that?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Did she break your heart?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and... well I should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. So, I've decided to make it up to you.
What's this?
Where's your master?
Go ahead.
Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
About you and Li Mu Bai?
No, really?
You say she killed a policeman?
You know about Lo?
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
Let's end this here.
Lo?
Let's stop a moment.
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
Don't send me back!
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
The Green Destiny Sword?  You're giving it to Sir Te?
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
Sir Te believes it's a ploy cast suspicion on Governor Yu.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
What in the hell... do you call that?
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Listen:  Top Dollar.  He "owns the street here."  He will "erase my ass."
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
Mom --?
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird?
What... the hell is that?
That thing is poisonous.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
We've got company.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
You a lesbo?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
The Fountainhead.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
Thank you.
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
How are you today?
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
And that's a bad thing?
You don't even know me.
That's also none of your business.
No, not at all.
Okay?
Sure. Have a good night.
Alone again.  What are you up to today?
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
Am I bothering you?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
Hi.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
Would you like a tour?
Why aren't you understanding?
You don't know how to love.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Well, I guess it's getting late. Please thank Kathryn for the use of her Steinway.
I'm in the bath, mom.
That's great.
What are you scared of?
Does your mother know?
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
But -
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
Oh baby... oh baby...
Whoa!
Yes.
Yeah?
Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Why not?
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
You can put it anywhere.
Fuck her yet?
I'm at your service.
Moving along quite well.
Who are you calling?
That her?
Shut up.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Tell me all the details.
I thought we should celebrate.
To my triumph, of course.
I can't tell you how happy we are that Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you this fall. You've always been an inspiration to Beau and I on raising her. We just hope she can rise to the high standards which you've set for her.
What about her?
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Who the hell do you think you are?!
She's not here.
She's out.
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
I'll do that.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.
I love the smell of pine.
But where did you get it, Amy?
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
All I have to do is look at Amy's eyes, blue and deep like yours.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
You're shouting at me.
What is it, Alice?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
I thought you were with Amy.
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Did you mail then?
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
Because you didn't ask them?  I don't blame them for being angry. Why didn't you explain what happened?
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.
Just you wait!
I've wanted a friend.
It stands so still.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
May I pet the deer?
But why?
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
A lady threw it to me.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
Hide me? Why?
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S: Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
There was a sale.
That bite healed up quickly. It's been about three weeks?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
Jennifer?
You haven't mentioned dating anyone since Mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
Translation: a total geek.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
George bit you?
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
So did you do it?
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
You're a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida, are you on drugs?
Get rid of him!
I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
I think I just got my period.
You're such a good friend.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
I tried to kill myself -- earlier. It doesn't work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I'm depressed I clean.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
I think George knows.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
I know.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
You look different. I mean you look good.
Where'd you get the bike?
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
Script coverage?
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Uh.... hi!
What happened?
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
What's with the squirt guns?
You at least owe me the truth.
Peter I love you too but...
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
Here's a towel.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
Dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.
No, it was our first date.
We can get a warrant if you like.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
You can't believe this bullshit.
Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax guys. It happens.
How the hell is that your business?
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let that Frida off the hook. You weren't even going to take the sheets. If I didn't know better, I'd think you liked her.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
What?
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
He means the last that we know of.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
How long have you been here?
Really?  And how is his state of mind?
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnt this his case?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
It seems fine.
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
That was a pretty good escape act at the station.  How did you do that?
Don't know that either.
Where do you think this goes?
Look!  This is a good one!
You see it?
Where does it lead?
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
I'm sorry.  About before.
What are you doing?
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
Why?
It's a trick.
Is this dangerous or anything?
How much do you usually get paid?
They barely talk anymore.
Dave...
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
What the hell is this?
That shelter was in this bill.
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Fine?
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
Nightmare...
Just don't call him, Alan!
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Uh, let me get back to you...
Three years.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
What are you gonna do?
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
What I told him to?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
Will he be alright?
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Gimme a quarter.
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
`Dave'?
Now he's making stuff up about me.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Yes, but I wouldn't...
This is from the people of Burundi...
What are they?
Oh... Hi.
How'd you get started?
Your government needs your help.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
You're kidding.
... How could I what?
Oh... Yeah.
That was quite a thing you did today.
You're leaving?
Where's home?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
What?
It was okay?
What?
I know. I'm sorry...
I never thought I'd...
So this is it?
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
His madness....could be from shock.
THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
Tonight?
That's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of course.
Thanks. I can fight my own battles.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
How long do we have to watch him?
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
What?
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
NOOOOOOOOO!
Come, come, Miss Science. You've seen worse.
Where are you going, Tyler?
Step up here, Tyler.
I don't know.  I don't get it.
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
All right.  I'll try anything once.
I hereby declare this the Charles Dalton Cave for Passionate Experimentation.  In the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
Yes sir.
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
You know what really excites me about you?
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately."  I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
Hello?
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Knox, I don't believe this!
Chris!
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  The Latin term for that sentiment is "Carpe Diem." Anyone know what that means?
We used to meet here on special occasions. Who would like to convene the meeting?
English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
Good god, boy! Yell!
Todd, there's a picture of Whitman over the door.  What does he remind you Of? Quickly, Anderson, don't think about it.
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Now there's the poet speaking!  Close your eyes and think of the picture. Describe what you see.  NOW!
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
Why do you do it?  I mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
You really think I should forget her?
She won't even see me, Pitts.
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
I will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
Don't you dare talk back to me!  It's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  But you deliberately deceived me!  Who put this in your head? How did you expect to get away with it? Answer me!
I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
Weird.
So what do you think of my father?
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
But if he said no before then...
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?
None of what Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Er  No.
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
Neil, you're not gonna...
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Follow me then to plainer ground.  God, I love this!
You should come to rehearsals.  I know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
It's not going to help us!
Who?
Right here...middle of nowhere...
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
We were talking about my schedule...
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
I'm not staying here!
Noooo!
I don't know where it is!
The "come back" kind.
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
You don't take orders very well, do you?
Where's you friend?
Let's just keep going.
So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
Hanover!! Hanover!!
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
You know what I'm gonna do after this...I'm gonna get a normal life...
It's okay...come on...
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.
She's gone...
Why don't you back off?
I thought the plan was we'd evacuate them after we got through.
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked me too.
She fucked us both.
You want 'em?
That's mustard!
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
I'll get the boots.
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.
I thought that was it.
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Tell him, Vince!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
Albert! For Christ's sake... John! Wait a minute, you guys!
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
Sure. Why not.
No, I --
See, I'm going home.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
No. None of that.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a minute, watch. There! D'j'u see that? D'j'u see the way he... You know what that guy is doing? That guy is squeezing her ass!
Holy shit!
Vince. Hey, you guys --
Hey, Nick...
Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
Linda, what's the matter?
What?
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
But --
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
What are you doing?
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
What'd he say?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
I suppose you wish you were somewhere else?
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
We gotta play with more bullets.
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?
I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
I like it, Nick.
No.
That's it. No. No way.
Where's Vince?
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Don't worry what it says in the book.
Great. That's great.
Great. Hey. That's great.
John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal. Jesus. When are you getting out?
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Did you get one?
Where?
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
Oh, Jesus!  You're kiddin'!
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright, everybody, Nick has a few words.
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
I think he wants more than your cookies.
Twenty years have passed, Wade. Lay it to rest.
Edicon system made these.  Ages, photographs.  We use it to find missing children.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
Tell Frick and Frack that means them too.
I want to stop aging.
This is a war, Wade.  You against him.  Vengeance time.  The City's just in the way.  Kill the fucker. You and me.  We'll work things out when the time is right.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
Sir---
No offense, but why'd they partner me with a rookie?
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Thanks.  Want'a bite?  McDonald's vegiroll.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
Hey, I'm eating.
Maybe I should turn myself in.
You're not pregnant, are you?
You treat her nice.
Your girl.  Being a cop will be rough on her.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
What are you doing this for, Sanchez?
You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
You all right?
I'm going to be a policeman.
You could always take it off.
Let's dance together -- Belle.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
Jabez -- ?
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
Loan shark -- hey?
What Grange?
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.
You're not -- Dorothy.
Never mind. What's your name?
Where's everybody?
Now run along, Daniel.
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Jabez Stone -- did you or did you not sign this document?
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
Here's a man who knows what's good for Dan'l Webster! Medford rum! Ah, a breath of the Promised Land!  To the champion of the Iron Horseshoe, Jabez Stone!
They make plucky women in New England.  H'm ... how long have we to wait?
But -- I was just lucky.
Jabez -- help!
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
Mary--
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
It feels fine now, Jabez.
But I'm glad to be home again --
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
Well -- I -- I-
Why don't they come --
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
"There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and eschewed evil."
You know that, son.
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Helps sometimes to say it.
What's ailing that dog?
Well ... make him keep quiet.
You found it in the barn, hey?
Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
It won't be the first baby ever born in this house.  There! Made me drop a stitch!  Sit down, you make me nervous!  Lan's, that's the way a man always is. Thinks his son's the most important thing in the world.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
Mary! Ready? First bell's a-ringing!
No, you wouldn't -- You're not the sort of woman that's afraid of smoke -- or fire -- But now let's talk about your affairs.
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?
Just someone from New Hampshire!
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
Meanwhile, you still live in New York?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
The police...?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
Where are you going?
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
You're amazing.  You figured this all out already?
'Asian Dawn Movement?'
Bad for your health anyway.
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
--ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it --
You...you don't work for Nakatomi... and if you're not one of them...
Hans.  Your Hans.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
Encourage them to be bolder.
Go on.
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
What are you doing?
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain.
How do you know?
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Two.  And I'd sure like to see them swinging on the jungle gym with Al junior.
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
Hey, don't take the car!
What guns?
Hello.  Hello, Leon.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
What am I supposed to do?
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Look... don't throw that on me.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
They won't talk to you.
Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
How many you got in there?
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Calm down, you're not ...
Okay, what do you give me?
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Don't fuck with me ...
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
Do you think we can turn it on?
Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
You shouldn't start now.
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
It's the cops.  Shit!
Sal, I'm sorry about this.  But we can get outta this thing.  There's a way outta this.
I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal ...
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
There it is, Sal.  Sal?
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
I don't want him.
Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language.
Hey, let's get ready!
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Oh my God, mother!
Don't talk to them anymore.  Sal and me are getting a jet, we're going to Algeria - I'll write you from there.
We can't stay here.
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
Newsman, not ...
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
You could give up.

No!
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.

How come you're not at Sal's?
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
I'll see you out.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
Nice!

I didn't know that.
You're it.
Can he do that?
I don't know. Owwww.

Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Who cares? Chicks are for fags.
It's really not up to you, Harry. But we just want you to feel like you're part of the decision.
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
You're it.
It's okay. I want the rush.

But my mom gave me the map.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.

Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.

What?
Sorry, Charlie.
Are you wearing a coconut bra?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.

What are you doing here?
What?
What are you doing?
I'm so close I can feel it.
How much homework is there?
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.

THE PAIN!
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing.... Do they come true?
Well he isn't... and he won't die... Tell me he won't die!
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
You mustn't speak of...
Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract so easily.
Mr. <u>Lugosi</u>!  It is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself... I am CRISWELL!
So <u>you</u> sleep in coffins?!
Who are you?  What do you want?
Why were you buying a coffin?
You know, I saw you perform "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
They don't want the classic horror films anymore.  Today, it's all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Let me take you to the hospital.
Bela, I don't know what I'm doin' anymore...
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
In life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just don't know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  Years ago, the Hungarians contacted me.  The government wanted me to come home, to be Minister of Culture.
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
No.  Seriously.  I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done for me.  A great man like you shouldn't have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
Don't you have any savings?
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Okay.  But what if I'm not in <u>too</u> big a hurry?  What if I take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  To smell a flower?
And, cut...
Sorry...
Jesus!  Are you serious?
This is gonna be Bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! Like one of those mad scientist movies.  I want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
You really think so?
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
I don't understand.
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Goddamn landlord.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
I'm going to my mother's.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Mr. Ward, it's a delight to meet you.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
I don't know... this is all a lot to absorb.
And PERFECT.  CUT!
Could we moovf to table?
So, Mr. Johnson --
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
Tor, I should be getting home.
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
My eyes are killink me.
Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
Is there a script?
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I've never told anyone what I'm about to tell you... but I really want this job.  I like to dress in women's clothing.
Lugosi?
"Where's the ads"?!  The ads are in Alabama, Indiana, and Missouri!  You schmuck, it ain't gonna play L.A.!
The marriage already ended.
Oh, it's you again.
You look beat.
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
I don't understand.  Do you want my autograph?
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
You know, to make the legs move --
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
Wow.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
ME?!  No, uh, I'm just a transvestite.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
They celebrated the common person.
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
So?
You know what would be great?
What did you study?
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
They tore her dress! ...
Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Take him off the air.
With all due respect, Cynthia you're nuts. I'm giving him another month!
Isn't this getting kind of pathetic. I mean we drank the juice, now we're just licking peel. Let it go!
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
What?
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?
Are the TV people with you?
Hey, he cheated on her.
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Yes.
What's the difference?
Who?
What happened?
Oh my god! On TV!
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Ed! How did you know I was here?
What's going on over there?
What is she, at work?
She won't.
Are you asking me?
Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
Are you sure about this?
So?
I mean bad.
Oh my God.
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
Um...
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
So...?
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
There's a list.
She lied to me. I mean all my life, she's telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. Come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. No. Not in my house. The truth is a stranger. And this is why Ray and Marcia are the way they are. Marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "How do they find me" she says. Ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I'm the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... Oh, man... Are you all right?
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
Kinda'.
Show business.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
I got your message. Way to go!
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
I'm doing all right.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Uh, no, uh I'm a little tired. I fell asleep.
Hello... Shari, hi... Oh no! ... Oh God!
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
You brought the girl!
Um... They gave me a limo, uh...
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Ohh... do you own a cat?
We don't have foibles.
What does that have to do with... ?
Sign here, please.
By the X.
You're not just jealous, are you?  I mean, we both used to talk about her
Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
How'd it go?
What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
You're kidding, right?
It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
Well, good luck there, Tracy
I got all my signatures.  One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
NO, that's fine
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
I don't.  I just know they were there when I left.  I'm giving you helpful information is all.  You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
What do you mean?
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
So, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
Where to?
I hope so
Jim, where the hell have you been?
Walt will be speaking with you about this, but I need you to find someone to take over my classes. The lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
And how did you get in the school?
I don't believe you.
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
More this way.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Right now?
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
These are private -- these are for us.
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
You dumbshit!
Now could you leave me alone?
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
Tell me about Patchett.
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
I want to know about Exley.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide.
Will you work for me?
You know him?
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Mrs. Lefferts, I'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D.  I'd like to ask a couple of questions.
What's through here?
Don't mind the smell.  I think a rat died behind the wall... My Susie was a good girl!
Yeah, that's Stens.
One in six.  Where's the girl?
Dudley's guys.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
It's a suicide note.  Says he killed Jack because Jack had figured out a pornography scam Patchett was running.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
Whose shoe?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
What do you mean?
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
Where are the police academy files?
You look like Robinson after that last LaMotta fight.  'Course LaMotta looked a lot worse.  So you're twenty-two, right?
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes?
Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean.
Reciprocity, Mr. Hudgeons, is the key to all relationships.
And?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.
Yes, I do, sir.
I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
You're the key witness?
Even I'm not that crazy.
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
So what's the point?
I'm trying to figure what angle you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I sure as hell can't see one.
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
She is Lana Turner.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
How about White?
Where will you go?
On what evidence?
Do you have any proof?
Let my Susie rest in peace!
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Jack!  It's Christmas!
You're back, boychick.
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
Was it a party?
It'll be our secret.
DePinto's dead.
What'd he say to you?
What'd he give to you?
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
I'm doing a transfer now.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Okay.
What <u>is</u> that?
I'll pay you.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
What'd I tell you?
That was twenty years ago. With digital? They can suck a salt grain off a beach.
They're here.
Gimme that.
Listen to you, "directly". You're not gonna get <u>near</u> the News Department. And if you did, it'd never get on the air. Time-Life buried the Zapruder film for 15 years.
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
Reynolds.
You wanna get caught spying on Albert?
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
That's fine.
It's a little late for that.
What size?
Remain calm.
I know, but--
That's my point.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
No, sir, I'm not involved with that. I'm doing a quick follow-up on a bus accident took place a few nights ago. Your name keeps coming up.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Than why can't you tell me.
I'm just trying to determine if Mr. Zavitz was involved in something more than a simple bus accident.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?
I'm sorry.
Bobby?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
You <u>swore</u>!
Oh, please--
Stacy--
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
I know.
It wasn't me.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
It's really over?
You don't know who the fuck--
It is fish.
Do you like fish?
Why would I--
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
I gotta go.
That's temporary.
What makes you think it's you?
Yeah?
You're wrong.
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Otherwise you may have to what?
Hey!
They claim you helped create a shell company for Sam Vollotti in Zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the Gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.
Who would do that?
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
Jerry--
They're framing me.
Jerry--
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
Go to 'em, Jerry.
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
Yeah.
What is it you want?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
Who?
No sir.
Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Federal Express?
No thank you.
Daskylus
Which stall?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness.  Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  I should like to have them.  I should be honored.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
Will you not come in?
You sew very badly.
When were you most happy?
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
Why did you hold his collar?
Why did he bring you?
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
I'm sorry, Katharine.
A broken car?
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
I was talking about the girl.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
Which we've overflown twice.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
David Caravaggio.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
I'm okay.  Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other.  I can shoot a pistol!  I'll sleep in the stables.  I don't care where I sleep.  I don't sleep.
Oh, all over.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
Thought you'd never wake up!
Hana tells me you're leaving.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition.  It did this.  If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Oh.
Right.
Good heavens, are you married, Madox?
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
That's a different dress.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
Arguing about books.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
For my hair?
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Will you come with me?
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
Only we have to go to work.
Your book.  Your Herodotus! Almsy looks uncomfortable.
Katharine!
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
Kip?
No.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
And the draft blew over the flowers.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
But Roki said--
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Fine. What do I do?
But--
What's my problem? You want a list?
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
And good morning.
I go in alone.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
Someone was expecting that.
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Why don't we take oxygen?
Let's do it again.
You bought this for me?
To us. To the Mask.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
He wasn't.
And--
You can't be too careful.
Can you see the other PIRs?
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
We're living history here.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Well...What are we doing?
Peoples China Bank.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
You have something in mind?
But would you--would you--
The sign of our partnership.
Jesus.
I cannot get rid of you.
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
In the van.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
Tonight your league night?
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
She's calling the shots now.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
Where've you been?
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
His dry cleaners.  You want him?
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
Whoa.  Remind me.
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
I can put them in a good school.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
This is the only thing you found?
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Bullshit.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here.  This is some damn good work.
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
What kind of things come up?
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
Counts?
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
When?  Where?
I don't know what to say.
I was wrong.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
Two million dollars?
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Mommy, can I get a flower?
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
PG& -- Are you sure?
Hey -- those are my files --
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Which number do you want, George?
Cause I don't even know you.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
More than you need me.
They up?
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
And I miss you.
Think you could learn?
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
-- toothbrush, toothpaste, and a pair of hose.  Here.
There's something else, too.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
What?
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
You must survive, Luke.
... the power?
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
The temperature is dropping too fast.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
Captain Solo.  What's the situation?
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
Sir, I was wondering ...
What are you so grouchy about?
Am I?  I say you came running after me because you were afraid I was leaving you without even a kiss.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
That was no earthquake.
Stop that.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
There's something out there!
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
You do have your moments ... Not many, but you do have them.
I don't like this.
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
About what?
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
I must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  Truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
What's going on?
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
Someone's falling.
The speeders should be ready in the morning.  They'll make the search easier.
Closer?!
A tremor!
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
Where are you going?
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
Calm down, will ya?  Tell me about Han.
Jabba the Hutt?
I can't. It's too big.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
No, no.  This will not do.  Anger is what you feel.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
The Force runs strong in the Skywalker line.  You will achieve great power ... Come, join with me!  Together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than The Emperor.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
Did you call the Zoo?
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
What are they doing here?
Humans?
Primitive?
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Who's that?
He doesn't look like his picture.  I bet he's fake.
He's... near.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
I'm already dead.
See you in hell, Snake.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Top secret. Only on a need to know.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
Plissken...?
Plissken - this is Malloy. Do you have the prototype?
Got a smoke?
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Location.
I said pull over.
Later.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
What're you doing in here?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Don't follow me.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
I can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
All of us?
Is he coming?
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
But your life and lands are far from here.
They miss the battlefield. I think we do too.
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
Perceval, you have returned!
You saved me from the arrow...
Excalibur! Is it true?
Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
I must do it myself. I must kill them both. Lancelot and Guenevere. Will you ride with me, Merlin?
Quiet. You'll wake the men, and they must fight tomorrow for their very lives.
But, I'm here.
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
No, I think it's better if you just stay here to heal. At least a week.
He must stay for the feasting days of our wedding, and tell his deeds himself.
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Who does it serve?
I have waited long for you. Once you almost saw, but fear blinded you. Why am I served from the chalice?
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
To me? But why?
There are things about love--
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
What honey?
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
And you got an invitation.
What's Burke got to do with it?
Phonograph.
It's serious?
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Would you like some more coffee?
Excuse me Miss?
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
She used those words?
Well, It's a symptom of a type of desturbance in the chemico- electrical activity of the brain. In the case of your daughter in the temperal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain. It's rare, but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
We still think the temporal lobe...
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Did he tell you about my party?
You wouldn't.
If a person was possessed by a demon of some kind, how do you go about getting an exorcism?
I didn't get you?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
Did you know my mother died recently?
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Yes. He's already here.
Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
We'll see when we get home okay.
Wait a minute you need two.
You really don't want me to play huh?
Yeah
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Oh my God!
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
Goodnight Dims.
She seemed fine.
Do you like films?
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
Another one. Had your lunch?
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
Quod nomen mihi est?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
What's that?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
The Lord be with you.
Amen.
Shut up!!
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Really?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
It's possible. Possible however
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
I get passes to the best shows in town. Mrs. K though, she gets tired and never likes to go.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Almighty Lord, word of God the father Jesus Christ, God and Lord of all creation, who gave to your holy apostle the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions. Grant me, your unworthy servant pardon for all my sins...
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
...look down in pity...
How old are you?
Give me the keys.
Give me the keys.
What're you saying, Charlie?
Honey ...
They gotta go.
Decay unfortunately doesn't limit itself to the denture, Mr. Baker. It spreads into his chest. Then the heart goes. We wouldn't want that, would we?
Piano.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Twenty years, Ma ...
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
Jack.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it been, Jack?
Count it.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
It was an accident.
Cindy.
What d'ya got?
Really.  You sleeping?
It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
We gotta go, Jack.
Your older brother.
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
Nice, huh?
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
What was it like?
A gust of wind killed him.
I'm not unhappy.
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
Where the hell is she?
Get out of here.
Very realistic.
November.  '71.
I thought we had separate rooms.
He's drunk.
All night?
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night.  For a week.
What's the matter with you?
How dare you say you love me.
How long you been at it?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
What're you doing?
What channels it on?
What-are you?  A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank.  Who's watching?  Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
You weren't there.
Right.
Go ahead.
Hey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have that drink after all.  What's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
How're your hands?
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
So what'd you think?
Moran.  Monica.  The whole thing. It's my stage name.  My real name's Blanche.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
This where the auditions are?
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
Ready?
It's orange!
Nine!
They're tight.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Maybe it's legit.
You two could play checkers.
Peggy Lee?
Hey, will you look at that?
What do you say we send a bottle over?
What's with you two?
Is that important?
Funny hours.
Right.  Bring him back.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
All right.  Hold on.
And you don't?
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
Fucking.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Where's egghead?
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Aren't the kids asleep?
So why's he do it?
I can keep the beat.
What's that supposed to mean?
You were good.
Friend.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
History.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Jack.
Jack.
John.  It's good to see you.
Big piece or little?
None?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
What did he do?
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
Perfect fit.
Nice-looking kid.
And this thing can grow it?
Pollux ...
Uh -- to kill the doctors?
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
That's not the worst part.
Thanks, Pollux.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
I took it from my fake husband.
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
Go on.
Now what?
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
Jamie ...
You better be nice, Castor. You could get mighty lonely now that Pollux is gone.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
Clarissa left those here.
When did you start smoking?
Did it look like I was siding with him?  Did it?  You want to play with the bad boys, you better be prepared.  Do you have protection?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
Commander, what are you doing here?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
What about me?
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
Just following your example.
I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
Nothing.
Where's Jamie?
I'll deal with her later.
I'm going to the powder room.
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Mr. Mintz.
Rise...and...shine...!
Mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
This isnt my real life. Its just a glimpse...
This is day care.  Its where babies go when their parents are at work.
What am I saying?  You dont need to hear that...  All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all.  Is that you?
Trouble at work?
Wheres your follow through?  Wheres your stance?
Hey Jack, youre all flush.  I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Cmon, Evelyn Thompsons got no class.  She doesnt marry Dr. Steve, the womans living in a trailer.
So Jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
Wheres my car?!  Wheres my Ferrari!?
Cmon Jack...
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
What're you talkin' about?
Something like that.
Mr. Mintz?  I dont think so...buildings closed pal.  Youll have to come back tomorrow.
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
Here we are, mag wheels...  Hey Jack, are you sure youre okay?
Kates on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  Im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Jack...dont even start...
What are you doing?
Yes, Im fine.  Its just this god awful football phone!  Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Hey!  I was watching that!
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Look, Im sorry.  Im sorry I was such a saint before and Im such a prick now.  Maybe Im just not the same guy I was when we got married...
Our life in a nutshell...
Maybe I should wait...
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Jack...can we afford all this?
Now Im worried...just say it.  Whatever it is well deal with it.
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
I think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  Its very human.
I could stay here forever...
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
Whats going on?
Dont get on that plane!
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
Damn...damn...damn...
Last night was great...
I want to see you again.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
Ill go for a cup of coffee!
I found it!
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
How'd you know it was me?
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
How long was I out?
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
You got a chisel round here?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Please tell me your dawg's not trying to rekindle things with my sister.
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
No more cracks about how I look.
What did you wish for, honey?
What do you want, Vic?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
Twenty?  From outside the place looks a lot taller.
He's right.  These costumes are... missing something.  I can't put my finger on it --
And where do we think we're going?
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Sweet.
I'm driving.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
You know, maybe you should get some rest --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
<u>Abort</u>?  Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will <u>not</u> let you make me look like a fool --
What are you doing here?
But I'm not done with the machine --
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Uh, Sue...?  I <u>can't</u>.
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
If we can build a machine to re-create the storm, we can reverse the polarity --
Reed.  How close are we to a cure?
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
I found a broken gasket, from space --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
'Scuse me.
Grant's uniquely qualified for this mission. He's a Communications Expert and was a Frogman during the War. Besides, he brought Benes into this country, and the fewer people who know about him, the better. At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable, should anything go wrong once you're under way.  Okay, Don.
Okay to proceed.
We still have fifty-one minutes. Leave them in.
What are the problems in stopping the Heart?
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
What is it?
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
I assume Benes knows how to control it.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Just one, General...
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
Difficult? He's impossible!
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
That's beside the point now.  I don't see the sense of going on.
Doctor...
What is it?  Anything wrong?
Doctor...you can't mean that! Not when we've come this far. And if we give up, there'll be no way of saving Mr. Benes --
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
-- at which point the Heart will be stopped by electric shock.
What can we do?
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
You said there was a quick way out!
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
A what?
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
Sabotage? I don't understand...
You have no right to blame Duval --
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
What'd you do that for?
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
All in all, quite a canoe...
How's it look?
Even so, because of our size -- I mean lack of it -- we'll still be cruising mighty fast. We'll be smashed to bits if there's any turbulence --
We could never fight that current it's physically impossible.
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
Drop that fucking money!
Just in town on business. Just in and out. Ha ha! A little of the old in-and-out!
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
She started shrieking, you know.
One of us pays the other for half.
Huh?
Oh, no, it's real sound. It's all worked out.
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
...Who's Jean?
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Yah, okay, but, uh -
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
Yah.
...So, I'm tendin' bar there at Ecklund & Swedlin's last Tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'So where can a guy find some action - I'm goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  And I says, 'What kinda action?' and he says, 'Woman action, what do I look like,' And I says 'Well, what do I look like, I don't arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and I says, 'Well, this ain't that kinda place.'
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
The numbers y'asked for, calls made from the lobby pay phone at the Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
A subconscious-type thing.
You're not a C student.
And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
We're not horse-trading here, Wade, we just gotta bite the bullet on this thing.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah, real good.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
Yah.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
lot. It's a limited -
Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Geez, you okay, Margie?
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
Yah - how are you doon?
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
Nope.
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Sorry - didn't copy.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Whose car?
...Chief Gunderson?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
...So?
It's just the three cent.
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Oh, my.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
You are a moron.
This was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  The big moosie slobbering all over me was Bob.
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
You are?!
I'm going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  We've got some "red-flags" to cover.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
The dynamite...
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
We need to talk.
And I saw you practicing this...
Telling me off.  Is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... Mr. Taylor."
Why are you doing this?
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
I want that.
Looks like this is goodbye.
How did you find me?
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
What are you talking about?
Where?  Here?
I think everything's okay here.
You... don't have to... leave.
You hear that?
He's not here.
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Because... I'm Tyler Durden.
What?
Why are you doing this?
I'm not paying this back.  I consider it "asshole tax."
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
You see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
I don't... think so.
Yeah.
Can I stay at your place?
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
... Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
But a good strange.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't know my dad.  Well, I knew him, till I was six.  He went and married another woman, had more kids. Every six years or so he'd do it again -- new city, new family.
I know that.
Same here.
Where's your car?
What are you reading?
Unbelievable, huh?
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
You want to finish her off?
What is this place?
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
We don't need him...
What... ?
I asked you what you studied.
Hey.
Where did you go, Psycho-Boy?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
Four in Milwaukee.
Why did you do that?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
Wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
You have jobs.
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
Fuck you.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
You want out?
Tyler...
Defuse the bomb?
Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
But, in Project Mayhem, we have no names.
Is this a picture of Mom and Dad?
S-S-Stuff.
The survivors of Flight 180 died in the exact order they were originally meant to die in the plane crash. That was Death's original design.
Officer Burke pulled me away from the crash that killed my friends.
If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
What are you doing?  You're going to kill us!
Another premonition?
What do you want me to do?
Remember the onramp?  There was a pregnant woman in a white delivery van.
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
You've made your point.
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
Please.  It's not going to wait.
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means "good luck" in Jewish.
You mean Alex Browning.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Mom?
I can't go home. After Lewton's, they'll be after me.
Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
Can't you open the door?!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
You know what to do.
I'll remove him.
I got this... feeling... a weird feeling... I can't explain it...
I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
And don't pass on the right.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
You mean the snake?
What's that?
... and there's this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he's got this sword... except it's not a sword, it's light...
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
Gettin' old, huh?
What do you call that?
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
I was in the brig.  They gave me a deal.  I blew up this Colonel's golf cart with an M-19.  He wasn't in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
We'll check it out.
How you doing, Brewer?
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
Yes you can.
Look, Co...
Stay on your heading, Captain.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
Where?
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
Typical...
Um... actually, no.  It looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
How long before you're fully on line?
Take your time.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Hello, John.
Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
What did you want?
Fine.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
No really..I can't.
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Yep! Right on it!
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
... So... where did you sleep last night?
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
No.
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body.  Do you know what that means?  What this could lead to?
Yes.
Which ones?
A list.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
So how do we do this?
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
No... thanks... Listen --
<u>What</u>?!
They said you're The One.
... Do you know who I am?
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
I'm not married.
Why did you do that?
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
Will you shut-up!!!
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
Happily married, probably.
Will you stand still so I can do this!
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Beautiful night huh?
Are you all right?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
No.
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
You're depressed that I come along.
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop.  How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Bobby...
Look at my car! Piece of shit! I just bought it brand new from a used-car lot, and the steering goes to the pot on me!
We'll get off in Washington and hook another ride.
Alaska.
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
No.
Robert...
Robert, I have to tell you something...
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
What questions?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
With applesauce?
I'm talking to you, Tita!
You're leaving?
You were going without saying goodbye?
What have you been doing since then?
Swimming?
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
If you're free.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Is that funny?
Why?
I don't find your language that charming.
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
That's three games to none, Carl.
Robert, I think you better just...
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
You've been staying in a motel all this time?
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
But I'd like to say, so that I don't dampen the spirit of your adventure...
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
Don't call me "mack," honey.
Pardon me?
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
Wussup?
Remember me, from the pool?
A play-ya.
See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
Who gives!
Fa what?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
What are you going that way for?
Yo! What you goin' for
Like this?
You here to see somebody?
Where you know Amanda from?
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
I wasn't asking.
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
Fletch!
For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh --  Ever serve time?
My pleasure.
The two surfer boys?
You gonna nail the chief?
Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort.
You're in the Records Room.
Can I get you something?
Is there anything particular you're looking for?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
Good evening.
I'm Harry S. Truman from Casewell Insurance Underwriters.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
That's Brazil.
Because we can't.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
A .357.
Will you kill me?
W-Y-K no 'c.' I'll be down in a minute.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
Thanks.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
That's a strange combination.
Stay!  I must be having an off day. I'm really a fabulous player.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
What's he doing in Utah?
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I really should change.
I mean put clothes on.
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
What about his parents?
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
So?
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
I've never lied to him before.  It's the first time he's ever lied to me. He was just as convincing as when he says 'I love you.'
Oh God, I hate things that start like that....
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
I'm terrified.
Don't worry, I can take it.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
I commend him on his choice.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
Who?
I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight.
This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. 
Fletch, you want an apology?
And, I'm sorry, who are you again?
Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Now that we've broken the ice...
Ouch... Of course I want off the case.  Some monster from Woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  The fact I'm alive's a technicality.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
So many assholes, so few bullets.
Julian's happy as long as he doesn't see glass shatter.
You wish.
So what about this watch?
Sorry, Jazz.  After this, I'll throw a burger down your throat, okay?
How'd you get this from her?
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Ah, an obvious choice.
I believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  What were your words...  'A fucking C.D.  This case is closed.'
Three hundred.
A simple 'please' would suffice...
Let's get serious...
What?  Jesus, tell me!
Zuzu, wake up...
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
Hey.  God.  You're an asshole.
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
Gut feeling.
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
It's me.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Like me.
What's fine?
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
So what did you think of the ballet? Was it like a warm Ice Capades?
Uh, nice piano.  Probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  It's another time, Julian, another place.  If I told you Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and Colleen Sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
It doesn't have to be like this?
What about Don?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
'Bye, Johnny...
So...
I am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and V.C.R.s.  There's four thousand here.
What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
You don't use shit?
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
Got a wife named Angie.
Who knows?
I don't...
What?
Henri c'est gentil d'tre venu.  Je vous prsente mon associ, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Henri... I need one more favor from you.  I know I am imposing...
Allo... Salvatore...
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Regarde mon pcheur de baleine... Tu sais il va faire trs froid cet hiver.
Le sommes nous?
Sale boulot.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
What's your story?
You're in show business.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
Popeye.
It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
What about Sal?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
Sexual assault, Daryl.  Five years.  But you got lucky, right?  You got away with something else.  Something you figured nobody knows about.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
You okay, man?
Frank, we need to talk...
What do you mean?
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
15-band closes down at night.  During the day you can chew the band with China if you want.
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
29 years...?
Oh my god.
What's that?
No wait, don't go!
Dad, I gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
Whatta you mean...
You ever talk to a victim's family?  The one's left behind?  They don't act like what you'd think.  There's panic and fear.  But mostly, it's like there's this logic problem.  And if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  But if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  Just a glimmer.  But somewhere they know.  They know their world is never gonna be the same.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Got it.
Hey, what about the Amazin's?  They pull it off?
Yeah, you betcha.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
How you feeling?
This is the Space Cowboy.  I'm an intergalactic traveler from the Federation planet earth.
You're not looking too good.
That's what we need here, Satch.  A lucky break.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you...
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
Sullivan?
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
Who brought up this bright idea?
How about a roll in the hay?
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
How do we do it?
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!
It's dark down there.
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
Which one is it?
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
What are they saying?
What's this?
A hammock?
No.  I got here just before you did.
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
This is too painful to look at.
Why did you come back here?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What happened that night?
Hi.
What d'ya got in there?
In that little thing?
Faster!  Eat faster!
See anything?
This is no time to celebrate!
We had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but Shelly made them see the error of their ways.
I never said you were "nothing".
I thought that was the end of the song.
What?
Oh, jeez.
Is that all you found?
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
Never should've let her play.
But, Dad, we...
So what are ya drawin'?
Sorry, Megan.  Not this time.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
You mean you had a bad dream.
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
I just realized something. Where's Cort?  I haven't seen him for hours.
What's goin' on?
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
Don't concern yourself, Martin. This boy needs treatment.  We're taking care of it.  Sorry for the disturbance.
With extreme car, for God's sake. If that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
Doesn't that tell you something?!
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
I'm kind of busy right now...
Jesus!
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.
Good night, beautiful.
Get up!
You're talking about my lady.
Tell me.
Lock this asshole up.
Jessica, I'm so sorry.  I...I wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
Why didn't you tell me?
Does he know about what happened?
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.
Oh, my dear God...
I've told you the truth.
You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
But she might be in trouble...
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
No thanks.
I guess not.
What are you going to do?
Well...how do you feel?
Right.
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Christ...where's Rennie??
Jason's here in New York.
All right. But if it mysteriously disappears en route, I'll have you sent back home the minute we dock. Understood?
I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
Did you find Rennie?
What did you do with Rennie??
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.
What a beautiful day.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
Whatever you've been...imagining... has nothing to do with Jason Voorhees.  I want you to be safe, Rennie. That's all I care about.
I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Yes...
I've got the numbers.
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Don't talk like that.
Tonight. What's tonight?
It's just a review.
What's the fuss? I don't get it.
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
He'll hate it.
Shoot him.
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
What do you mean?
Great game.
This could be it.
This could be it.
What about her?
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
What?
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
What else?
What else?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
Alma Wetzel.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
Go way. I'll call a cop.
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
We must have been heroic.
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Where's your elastic brace?
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
You're a family man, Frankie?
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
I don't know.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
I hate the Mets.
Yessiree, Bob.
Yes, Peter.
What's good?
You've worked with Elliot?
So does Elliot.
Endearing.
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
You know what.
I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
Would you like to meet him?
But you're his friend.
Do you think he can do it?
No one's waiting.
Yes.
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
"A high court judge has confirmed that Mr. Gandhi would have been within his rights to prosecute for assault since neither he nor Mr. Khan resisted arrest." -- I told you about English law.
What do you expect when you talk like that?
Enough.
No violence, please.
...and I knew something had to give. And I was determined to be here when it did.
You mean Gandhi?
What was he like?
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
You're an ambitious man.
I would rather march.
It is foolish if it is just to save the life of an old man.
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
Could we cut all news off? I know --
You almost sound like you believe that.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Who are you trying to convince?
Vincent, where's the shore?  We're too far out. We have to go back!
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
What a pity.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
That's the last.
From what budget?
How often do you test, Director?
We believe we have a suspect.
It's about the Director.
I have to know where you come from.
What about this?
You really need that much?
It's not too late to back out.
Who died?
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.
It's all right.
Come on--we're taking off.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
Is that all?
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Anything I've forgotten?

Yeah.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
Not that.
No bother.
I envy you, Jerome.
What about the car?
What is it?
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.
All it takes is a long arm.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
I'm in a hurry.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
Half a million.
I guess I'm kind of...
It's just been a while.
$250,000 right off the top.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
What about the bank?
Why?
If you don't start telling the truth... 
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
I trust...  Want to see what I trust... In God we trust...  The word's on every bill!!!
Are you hungry?
Okay?
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
You okay?
STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Can I help you?
Just in case someone gets a shot off.
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
One-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollies. Okay. Any questions?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Then you do it.
Where we go in1?
Let's just get to the border.
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
Two years.
I didn't know who Doreen was. Thought she was just another bird.
Yes.
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
What's it got to do with you?
Oh ay?
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Five grand. It belongs to you. Along with a little name I'm going to give you.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Where's he living these days?
She's nothing to do with me.
Though nicer than most?
Why'd you see him so regular?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
Sid Fletcher.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
Very lucky, I should think. You're drunk!
Is he coming here?
You sure about that?
Tell me about the girl.
Was it Albert?
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
That must be interesting.
What you having, Jack?
Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Ever been into an arcade there and put a penny in the slot machine?
What happened to you, then?
Did they give you a rough time?
No, I didn't,  Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
I'm staying with a friend.
Is he staying the night?
You don't look it.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
I'll call the police.
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
What about Keith?
Did you sleep well?
Are you tired?
Meaning what?
Well, well. Small world, isn't it?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Cyril didn't like it, either.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
What's that? A hundred?
I'll see you, then.
You have to cheer up, George, you aren't out yet.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You ever get 'em?
...this shit...
It's not.
And it's not right to the customers.
No.  That's absolutely right.
Yes.
No.
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
He's doing very well.
Starting up.
...you're absolutely right.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
How do you know he'd buy them?
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
In the abstract...
Do you need five grand?
Fine.
I, you know, they should be insured.
It is dead.
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Were the leads...
A waste of time?  Why?
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
They're inured to it.
Did the leads come in yet?
Wh...wh...Wha...?
Who used to say that?
Shelly: get in the office.
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
I want to work today, that's why I came...
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
What about the other two?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...you talk to Murray...
...and I'm going to get bounced and you're...
The premium leads.  Yes.  I know what they cost.  John.  Because I, I generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen senny-nine, you know what I made? Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand dollars.  John?  For Murray... For Mitch...look at the sheets...
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
Then put me on the board.
What are we going to say?
I'm not sure I have two.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
No.
Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads! Williamson!  Send me out!  Send me out!
Get 'em to me!
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
Mmm.
Mmm.
You are?
What are you trying to tell me?
How do you know I made it up?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
No.  It hadn't.
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
I sold them to Jerry Graff.
Do I have to tell you?  Moss.
I've got the check...
Why?
Shit.
Williamson, get on the phone, call Mitch...
They took the leads?
Just now.
You closed 'em today?
I own the property, my mother owns the property, I put her into it. I'm going to show you on the plats. You look when you get home A-3 through A-14 and 26 through 30. You take your time and if you still feel.
I wanted to speak with you about...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
You're sure?
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
I'm sorry...?
Rick...?
Yeah.
Ricky, I...
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
What was yesterday?
What is?
No, Jim.
I can't regotiate.
What...?  Say the words.
What power?
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
You cashed the check?
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Bring that shit up.  Of my volume. You were on a bad one and I brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  You'd harbor it a long long while. And you'd be right.
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
You closed him yesterday.
...you want to go out today...?
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
On your pillow.
Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the &quot;Genco Olive Oil Company.&quot;
Fanucci is not connected; he is alone.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
Then why do you come to me?
Is Kay coming?
Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
Fredo.  Where are you going?
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I can handle things.  I'm not dumb Christ, not like everyone says. I'm smart; and I want respect.
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
Within the compound will be fine.
That's off now.
Where's my wife?
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
Why didn't someone tell me!
I'm sorry; of course, you know that.
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth?
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
Fifteen percent skim?
It might show.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
Yeah, but don't worry.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
Kay.
Why don't you sit down?
When he saw his brother in the hearing room, he knew what was at stake.  I don't think Vincenzo would have done it.  He loves the kids, too. Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It had nothing to do with me.  It was between those brothers.
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
We do favors for each other...
Enjoy.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
This doubles my investment.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
Not good.
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you.
I want you to help me take my revenge.
Trust me; do as I ask.
Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty?
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
He supports me.
Thanks, doll.
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
So what did you think?
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
How long you worked for Mr. Whale?
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
You did not know?
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
Everything alright, Mr. Boone?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Do you mind?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
Can I see what you did so far?
Sorry.  Not today.
Why not?
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
Everybody has stories to tell.
And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
What did I tell you?  Listen.
Is that really her?
Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already?
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
Is that --?
After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
Do you mind?
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
Just take off the fucking mask!
Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
Did I hurt you?
Sick stuff.  Necrophilia.  I wonder if they knew how sick they were.
By the way, I like the Renoir.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
He looks plenty big.  You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
He is not going to kill the old man?
Who was that at the door?
Mr. Whale, this is such an honor. You're one of my favorite all-time directors.  I can't believe I'm meeting you.
This is the studio where I paint.
Yes?
Mr. Whale?  Are you all right?
I was going to take a swim.
Can we get together while I'm in town?  I so badly want to sit for you again.
A boost. A big boost ...
Who was the job for?
Car-jacker. Neglected to clean up after himself ...
What's with the fish thing -- ?
Fish.
It's about my brother ... Kip...
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
Get out --
Well, that certainly won't do.
Good. Cos you know how it plays. Six years ago, I let you go free. But the next time ... The next time sends you away for'a long, long while ...
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
Not my girl anymore
I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
I'll catch you later, Randall --
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
What for?
How'd it go?
Diane 1.
What's the matter?
What about him?
Wow! They got Eleanor here -- ?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
Any word, Kip -- ?
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
oh.
The photo album. I get nostalgic around this time of year ...
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
I know...
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
You goin' home?
Sure -
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
This has nothing to do with any of that --
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
So what are you gonna do?
What happened to you?
What are you doing here?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
Reads the infrared. Then kills it. Little something the R & D department came up with ...
What era was that -- ?
Having fun, Kip?
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
Pop the trunk, Tumbler.
Shit ...
What are we gonna do -- ?
On account of Mitch?
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
I go with you --
That's what I want ...
Ready -- ?
C'mon, gang. Let's focus. Sway, can you prep 'em -- ?
The alarms go off ...
Hear you roar ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
What are you doing... ?
What -- ?
Some crew you got ...
Dinosaurs. All of us. The Ice Age is now...
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
What about me?
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
What're you doing? What about the car?
The bag with the envelopes.
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
Stop! Stop!
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
What about the schools?
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Keep 'em coming.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
It's a fait accompli?
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
You ready?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
Stay there.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
The third store down.
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Who's she talking to?
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
Chuckie, what the fuck happened?
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Hey, thanks for comin' out.
What?
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
You and Morgan throw?
You're kiddin' me.
Okay.
Oh...
Is this a bad time?
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Jesus.
WILL!
Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
How much money you got?
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
Come on, Will...
You got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
Some other guy?
Me and Bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. Morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A.
Where is it touching you?
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
Shall we start the, uh...
I told you to cooperate with these people.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
Well, I'm sorry.
This job... Do it if it's what you really want.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Good to meet you.
Why me?
Can we do it at my office?
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
Why would he do that?
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
--And confuse him--
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
--Yes you are, Sean. You resent me. And I'm not going to apologize for any success that I've had.
Hello, Sean.
I got one of those too.
You're right. I know.
I go places, I interact.
Did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Crayons?
Why thank you.
No.
You know, I was on this plane once. And I'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. Then he says "man, all I want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." So the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
Well, are you going out again?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
You missed Pudge Fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
Do you think you're alone?
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Don't give me you line of shit.
What?
I know.
I know.
I know.
I'll keep in touch.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Yeah?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
I really don't 'date' that much.
You grew up around here?
Yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
I think I can make it to South Boston.
C'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
Just for fun?
Do you play the piano?
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Then what are you afraid of?
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
I'd come back--
She's hotter'n a heifer.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
That's not your affair. Name.
How many men?
Can all of you work?
House 25. Number's on the door.
Two and a half cents.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
I guess that's right. Have to take a beatin' before he'll know.
But we can still do it, honey.
What's the matter? What's happened?
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
You ain't got to get sore.
You people got a lotta nerve.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
But you can't *do* that, Grampa. This here land is goin' under the tractor. We *all* got to git out.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
How 'bout Granma?
Ma. Pa.  Grampa, his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and bewildered, scratches in the dirt.
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
Where you going?
Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
I got to get a lot curiouser than I am--with all them cops out there.
Anybody ask anything?
Ma...  Ma, I--I can't go to the dance. I jus' can't Ma. I can't hardly stan' it, with Connie not here--an' me this way.
Jus' sassy, that's all.
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
Muley tol' me what happened, Ma. Are we goin' to California true?
Mad, Ma?
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Look, Ma!
Was Granma bad?
When?
Looks like you done it.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
They know he got hit in the face.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
What is it?
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
Here we go!
Just in case. Sit up back an' if anybody tries to climb up--let 'im have it.
But what about this?
Heh'o Tom.  This is Connie, my husband.
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Lemme go! I didn't go to do it!
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
You do not.
You do not.
So, what are you doing now?
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Never better.
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
Jesus...
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
It's always the little things.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Watched television?
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
Seven it is.
Are you there?
You look beautiful.
...Let me get my coat.
No time.
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
Like a union?
Thank you, no.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Lisbon?
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
He's falling for her. Look at him.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
In Detroit. This weekend.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
No, I don't have one.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
How did you get this job?
How are you? How's business?
I'm a professional killer.
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time.  You seem surprised?
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Yeah.
How long did you live here with your wife?
Why didn't it work out?
Ever think of moving there full time?
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Why don't you go lie down?
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
What?
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
That's not true!
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
When? Tonight?
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
It's me.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
What was I saying?
You've already made arrangements!?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
I'll help you with the coffee.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
You don't seem to upset?
What?
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
Ha...
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Of course I have.
Can you drive?
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
"... and I said that"...
Did you notice -- no cane?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Long enough.
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Let's keep her.
Oh yeah? What's that?
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
You're psyched. You need to lay off of that shit.
I want it to have my children!
Yeah?
Dead.
Dade?
Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week.  Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Shit! Come on!
Talk to me.
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
That's Razor and Blade.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Two days.
Here's your class.
That's a nice score for a girl.
I'm Crash Override.
What the hell are you doing?
It's too much machine for you.
It has a killer refresh rate.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
And if I win?
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
Alright, so what have we got?
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
Dade.
Security, uh Norm, Norm speaking.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Hello?
A rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak, dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
Yo, what's up?
So what are we supposed to do?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Hello, operator services.
I'll take you down there.
What?
Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
So?
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
Who's that?
You think she stands a chance?
Brady!
Shit!
Go!
I've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
Clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  Hello?
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
Now where are you going?
Has he been prepped?
What the hell did this?
Like the last time? How many people killed back then? How many kids?
Come on Rachel.
Jamie, what happened?
Jamie!
You don't believe that do you?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Hi Rachel.
You remember Lindsay don't you?
Logan, I want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
132 to 133 this is 134.
Get the outside shutters.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
How can a man do this Loomis? Tell me.
Where's that Deputy?
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
Why didn't you wait for me?
It's been totally charted.
Shit!
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
He was standing right here.
Hello?
You still spooked?
What's the pumpkin for?
Yes, you can.
You locked yourself in.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
Go get me a beer.
Yeah, sure.
They could be.
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
Is Annie around?
Okay. Later.
Hey, Laurie...
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.
Not any more.
'Neutron Man'... 'Laser Man'... I can see why. 'Tarantula Man'...
What about the rest of my comic books?
There WAS.
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
Hello.
There's nothing else I can do.
Pull up to the entrance!
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
...any sister talk?
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
No, really, I really like him a lot.
We're a big hit.
That's disgusting!
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
But I'm seeing him.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Is this your first job?
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Yeah.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
Mm-hm.
And it's just in one ear?
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
You--  Standards and Practices?
Child molestation is a touchy subject...
Yes, but you name names.
We--
Like, uh...?
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness!
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Uh, yes!
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
Oh, no, no, no.  It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
O-o-o-okay, Lee.  Okay, okay.  You, you, y-you've said enough.  It's my responsibility now.  I will work things out.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
They're fantastic.
You bet.
Where're you going?
It's so late.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
I want one with you.
No!
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
So?
Are you sure?
What's the problem?
Like what?
Oh!  Are we going to have this conversation again?
What are you going to use for money?!
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world.  Good God!  Have you been kissed tonight?!
Oh, yes, you have!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Yes, please.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Come on.
Oh, yeah?
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Oh!
Really?  That'll be terrific for him, I think.
What are you talking about?
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
What?  You're kidding!
Perfect!
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
Don't you think she does?
He's such a loser!
Ouch!
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Sometimes she's terrific...
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Boy--
Oh, gosh.
Well, that...th-that's fine.
You're too demanding.
You're crazy!  That's not true.
What's the matter?
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
Nobody ever said it.
You're okay, though, huh?
Right.
When'd you get here?
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
I can't think.
A reward for what?
And?
Well.  Word gets around.
...why?
...aren't you afraid of me...?
<u>Who</u> are these guys...?
Evelda Drumgo.
You want to get married...?
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
How crazy is that.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Hold up a minute...
Where was the call from.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
What do you want me to do?
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
...they're from Baltimore....
Now, why in the world would he do that?
He is...?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
Why?
Sir:
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
A fellow with five fingers.
Yes sir, I saw it. 
What'd you say, hon...?
Give it up, Evelda.
My husband brought it to me from America.
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
If your duty requires it.
And you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>La Vita Nuova</u>?-- 
How could you know?
...long overdue.
I'm not a scholar, Dottore.  But it seemed as if they, as if they...
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
You look lovely.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
Why should <u>you</u> care?
Mr. Crawford asked my opinion.  Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery.  Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
...what?
...what...?
Give me your gun...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
"Because we don't have any money."
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
What're they on about?
...a Dr. Fell.  A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post.
Then what brings you back?
Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
But.  He was a night <u>watchman</u>.  That's what he was.  N'They brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  N'then they took me off.  I <u>saw</u>... I saw.  Clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  His hat an his badge.  Clear as day, bulletholes and all.
My encounter.
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
You think you're so...but you're just...
Now what? What did I do this time?
No.
Howdy Pouty.
That would be a No.
Don't forget, when you get home, O.B.'s. They're created by a female gynecologist.
What are you doing?
You'll be hiding behind a tree.
Well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and I thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. I think we should discuss--
Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock fall off...
Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
I know what you mean. But it doesn't put me in too great a position...
Fuck off.
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
Iunno.  Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you <u>deliberately</u>                        ] destroyed us!

Sorry Veronica.
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
Gee, thanks.
I have a little prepared speech I give when my suitor wants more than I'd like to give him.... Gee Blank, I had a nice....
Oh, I have to hear this.
Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
J.D.? You seem pretty amused. I thought you were giving up on high school guys.
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Guess who?
Veronica! Color me stoked, girl. I've gotten <u>everyone</u> to sign this petition even the one who think BigFun are tuneless Eurofags. People love me!  My God, you haven't signed!
So some people need different kinds of "convincing" than others....  Hey, just sign the petition!
What are you doing?
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
Shit.
What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
Probably....
You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
I'm a Pine-Sol man, myself.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
You believed it because you wanted to believe it. Your true feelings were too gross and icky for you to face.
This knife is filthy.
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
How was the funeral?
Everybody cares for youth but nobody cares about Joey Blow. When that news reporter gets home he'll scream at his son for not mowing the lawn in the right pattern.
Dear Veronica, Heather was your soulmate.....Share.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
What now?
Bye.
Hello!
Come on, sit up.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
You have it.
I'm so happy to see you!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
Hello!
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
But, we're all going to Heaven!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
To be known as He!
Him.
That.
John has fallen in love with me!
How do you know? Did he tell you?
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Isn't it beautiful!
Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew.
Sorry.
Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Since what?
Bret... what the fuck...?
Hello I'm Dr...
Who's Allison?
What did you just say?
You could say that.
What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway?
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Never to put you in my will.
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
What evidence?
Sorry to take up your time like that Trevor. Don't work too hard. Oh, before I forget. I talked your neighbor out of pressing charges.
What happens if I'm convicted of Kirsty's murder?
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
Do you know where you are?
Poor Trevor.
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Are you ready?
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid.
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
You got a drinking problem or what?
Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.
Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce the bail?  If they didn't reduce it, how'dja spring me?
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
We're all assholes, Bernie?
What wouldja say if I toldja I ran into a burning plane an' saved a buncha people, Chick, an' risked my goddamnlife?
Yeah, like that.  Same thing.
Bill, I...
Bill, listen...
He waited for you three hours!
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
It's not right, Gale...
What's the matter?
What is it?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
Upset!  What's he upset about?
She wants to quit?
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
Helluva story!
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
He lost a shoe!
My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop looking for you.  From Robbery Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants you to call him.
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Give it here, Bernard.
So where are all your toys?
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm responsible for my own actions. It was never because I was angry with anyone.  I didn't mean to hurt anyone ever.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
As long as you keep remembering why.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Yeah, maybe you're right. Everything else is just an excuse. I'm treating the situation with kid gloves because I'm afraid of losing her.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Do you do washing machines, too?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
About what?
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
Mommy!
I could take a cab on the way home.
Where'd he go?
Honey --
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
But it's what we want.
He made, you know, a remark.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Do you remember who gave us this?
No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.
He wants to see me!
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
Who was that?
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
God, your sister's really hot.
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Promise?
I'd like that.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
Good -- also, give it to the papers and TV.
This ties in with Nash.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
When did you get back?
Where were you last night around nine?
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
You sure?
I'm gonna nail you, Nash.  That's a promise.
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Yes -- I think it is.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Maybe myself.
What are we doing here?
Yes.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
Well?
It will be a good harvest this year.
How comes it your are not afraid?
Aye?
Corpses?
You're hurt.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
No.
Why?
You're not an easy person to get to know.
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
Why not?
He's in there!
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
It has to be.
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
Don't leave us, Conner.
You kept it?
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
I could have ended it tonight, but I didn't.
Would you like to deposit this in your account?
The house belongs to Walter and Pamela Smith.  They've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, Jennifer and Thomas.
Wow.  Sure, right away, Chief.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
You get anything on Smith?
Our people out there, they good people? People in the right place?
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Jen?  Are you all right?
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
We could've gone out the back!  You didn't have to shoot!
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.
We're fucked.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
That you, Talley?
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
<u>Look</u> at him!  I think he's dying!
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
What the fuck is that?
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Donuts here any good?
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
We can't carry him.
What do you want?
What do you want?
We have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
Smith!  Wake up!
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
He didn't say.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
He says that his father's hurt.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
Chief, Mikkelson.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Don't worry about what we used to be.
What's my name?
We've got to get those kids out of there!
This is Chief Talley.  Tell me your name, son.
Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
Paul, Paul, a moment please.
What happened?
You want to pay me?
How much?
Ten thousand francs for each one.
Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. To let us drive off to the Mille Collines.
Ten.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
Paul, you know who this is?
Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved us all.
They fired a rocket at us.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
The Americans! Who are they to put us on trial. Let us imagine Paul when their president Kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. Then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. What do you think would have happened? No different.
Your police are at the gate?
You know what the Scottish call it?
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
I committed no war crimes.
I led no massacres.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Let's go.
Mr. Manager.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Paul, how the hell are ya'?
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Perfect timing.
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
What do you want?
You have our cards.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
I will need a suite.
Thomas wants advice?
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
Any luck?
How can we help him.
Go to the roof now.
What's the matter?
I have to go out to get food.
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
I have a confession. When we met...
A car.
Can I have your name again?
Paul, I pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. He told me it will not happen.
That is why they call it coach?
You have taken business class?
I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
Out? Where are you going?
Why the hurry, Roger?
I don't know.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
And how the hell are we going to do that?
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
Melissa!
Put it this way: if it's your face on that tape, Mr. Moses, we're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
What's in there?
What's down there?
Uhhhh...
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
And you're not really as large and useless as you seem.
Three steps forward -- I want to get up there.
Why not?
How you gonna manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome?
What the hell good is fixing that gonna get us?
-- you lose either way, Price --
This is the best we're gonna do.
It's okay, everything's okay now.
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
-- just not always in the sexual sense.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
Game, set and match, Steven. You've outdone yourself. And I know it's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it, but inquiring minds are desperate to know: just what did really happen to Ms. Marr?
They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
I'm ready now.
House 2, Guests 0.
What're you talking about?
Problem where? Looked good to me.
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
It works.
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Excuse me?
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
It looks delicious...
Where does this amulet come from?
Well then who did?!
H-how long will it take?
Your father doesn't love us anymore!
She's here.
She's down.  Help her...
I want this one, daddy.
Mommy!
I wish I knew more about her.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
Whoa there...
A friend?
Ok, so we have a...presence.  What do we do about it?
Is white meat all right for you, Mr. Shea?
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've been here before to cast evil from this house.  The amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   It is an ancient ceremony of the early Catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
How long will it take!
Do you mind if I borrow it?
There's something through that wall!
What do you mean?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
What will he do?  What does he want?
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
Under The Underground.  Can I like GO now?!
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
... well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's ... well, I know what it is.
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
The thing!  He was lying there in the street, moaning.  But he pointed at it ... 22
How have you ... ?
Yeah.  I found it.  I knew held like it and I figured ...
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Thank you.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
But you gave me a rose ...
Yeah really.  I'm ...
You're apologizing?
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
"And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo."
The Butler did it.  Guy was a cross between Alistair Cook and a Cuisinart. Dude took Mr. Ed and humptied dumptied it over Gates's head.  He said it was made by, get this, Leonardo..
Now that's a lock.
That was close....
I'm a ghost.  Boo.
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
This is the room above the Art Treasures room.  The lock is a Natalya Z-Z, first created...
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
Tough guy.  What are you--How's your head.
And I'll bring my entourage...
This is bueno.  They had the worst ketchup in prison.....uh...
Wha--
You better believe I can.  I'm sick of people telling me what I have to do.
Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
No, let me!
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Sure.  The Kremlin.  Makes sense. The Kremlin.  Why not?  Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man.  Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
Thanks for sharing.
The Shazzammeter!
I had twenty thousand shares! I'd be a millionaire now!
That smart?!
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
...Hello?
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
Oh, is that it!
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
...Certain people are --
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
I filed it yesterday.
You don't know anything! Fact is they haven't bought it! The stock is cheap, Archer! What're they waiting for?
Archer, you're a broken record. Fact is Gunderson did design it -- apparently he's some kind of prodigy --
Yeah, daddy, that's a roger, but we don't sell alcohol.
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
But, Buzz --
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
I got gas, Bennie.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
She finds him.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
She's good, Bennie.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
What's this?
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
I think you need some help.
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Is this disease common in the tropics?
The West Indies?
-- But, you're an American?
But what in the world can you do with a day off in St. Sebastian?
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
I wish I hadn't heard --
Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
A mental case?
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
Good morning, Miss Connell.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
I wanted to help you.
I told you.
You can't believe that.  You don't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad.  You're not vicious or cruel, Paul.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
You want that?
Considering that the paper is three months old and this isn't Sunday -- no thank you.
An accident at the mill?
In other words, I'm on trial.
If I were as sure as you, Mrs. Rand, we wouldn't be here.  I'll tell you quite bluntly: for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety, we've come to ask you to send Mrs. Holland away to St. Thomas.
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Right o'.
Benjie!
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
Good night.
You have to bring this up now? What? Did I do something here? Is that it? Is it something I did?
What?
Dinner in ten minutes.
I get you loud and clear... hey, you look nice.
Don't start.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
It's a starting place.
If you're going to insult me --
Damn it, Ben --
Ready to go?
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
I'm fine dad.
So how's school treating you?
Classes?
Anyone special? You know...
About?
See you.
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Fascist!
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?
Talking to me, dad?
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
Your toes cold?
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
But...
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Mikey Williams?
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Please don't.
How'd you know?
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Now you are being rude.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Where you going?
What?
You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon, our leader, all ye need know about the travails of life. Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
No candy for me?
Jesus, Jim!
Just be careful.
And I have a special feeling too, because I do. It's special.
Truly? Do speak.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
No one.
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
Did you tell Sandy?
You have to follow me?
See, no one's here. Maybe you want to go to the basement?
You get in trouble?
Hello, Charles.
Right.
They were old. And they couldn't fly anyhow. I'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at Christmas, and then I'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into Mrs. Burgess's English class and blow it up.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
Good.
You did your homework, Officer.
Duggar called him?
Walter Byrd killed Kay Connell.  Her things are in the house.
Sorry about...
He would have liked that.
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
We're sure it's hers?
That's right.
Where you signed this?
Did she?
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
I got it.  Don't know why I bother.  It's been broken for two years.
I'm not expecting anyone.
Will.
What if someone finds out?
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
It was like some big fucking secret!
No game.
I'm sorry?
Oh?
Thought you might find that.
I suppose.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
You're not following procedure.
Wild card.
But why?
Then blame the one who made her...
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
And the vampires of the Theatre?
Are these not the answers you came for?
A vampire with a human soul. An immortal with a mortal's passion. You are beautiful, my friend. Lestat must have wept when he made you --
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Why does he call you that?
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
He's dead, Claudia, dead.
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
It can't be -
He can protect us, Claudia.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Let's call that a start.
Come, you're going to feed now.
Yes, that's you, my handsome friend. And you'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
Lestat - finish this -
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Evil is a point of view. God kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. For no creatures under God are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
She's here, your wounded one.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
It's only a siren...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
You followed me here, didn't you?
It's just a room...
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
Well, what a lucky break for me.
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
You can't look at them...
The story about stakes through the heart?
Lestat escaped the fire!
You promise to care for her then?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
There's a storm comin', Titus. No boats are going out.
Say yes.
No means yes.
He does work hard.
Oh!
I'm the King of the World.
Hello? Hello?
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Cancer in a box.
There's no way to lock it.
Julie?
I'm holding your hand!
Ray, I can't...
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Checking the locks again?
It just takes time, Julie. It's gonna get better.
Is there a problem here?
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
I'll come with you.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
You think that's a good place to hide?
Don't really have the market for something like this...  I can go two...two-fifty.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
He leave you?
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
Take this.
They were cut loose.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece - the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
I took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests.
I'd like to, very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland.
It doesn't look much like the fish spears I knew back in Marblehead..
) You feel the symptoms?
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
Did you hear what Thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us.
You were singing, weren't you? A beautiful voice, Miss St. Aubyn.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Good night, Oliver.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill  or frightened.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
Your father loved me.  He wanted to marry me. But he was afraid of hurting the gentle, delicate Cathy. You spoiled his life you've ruined mine 
What if he is?
Woman, what are you doing here?
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure - quite sure.
What is her illness?
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
Daughter -- my daughter --
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Thea, what's wrong?
Thea, what is this? What are you trying to tell me? "He stole your mother" -
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there  he says he's an angel  he's tried to hypnotize me.
You what? To save me?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
What'd you say?
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
No.
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
She's . . .
Where? I don't see a thing.
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Splendid! Is he sick?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission  I mean  might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir  and people are beginning to talk.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Well?
Today, over at the house.
Hi, Daddy.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Old college graduate now, huh?
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Big  see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
He's gone. Don't worry. His name is Welch. He don't come in to my place no more.
Uh-huh.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Anything I can do back here?
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
You want a martini?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
Well, no younger than I was.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
Hey, George . . .
Hello, Georgie-Porgie.
What gives?
Where are you going?
I know, but . . .
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Holy mackerel!
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Pop!
Well, what about all your other friends?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Well, I don't.
I'm not very good at this.
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
Uh-huh.
If I told you it might not come true.
About what?
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Hi.
George Bailey lassos stork.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Mary! Mary!
Oh, George, George, George.
Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
You forgot something.
I can't wait to get there.
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
Yeah, it's her job.
Why not?
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
Why'd they decide to move?
What is it?
Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me or I will kick your ass, do you hear me?
Coming up!  Give way!
I don't know.
I thought you said she was going with us?
Want to talk about it?
Chief....
I never heard of a 908.
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
What about that camera?
I can't let you take her out.
Untie that rope.
You're too close.  Back off.
About 10 degrees off your star- board bow, take a heading leeward of Sand Island, and lay her north by northeast....
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
What else is there to do?
Because.
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
And sound.
Where the hell were you?
Can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man?
Sean's awake.
Mrs. Silvera?
You have to smoke so early in the morning?
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
I know what you're going to say.
Sean's asleep.
What?
What is it?  What's the matter?
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
Hi Dad.
Hang on!
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
You're not going out right away, are you?
She just likes to tease.  I think she really likes you.
Whoops, almost lost one.  Can't play with the dolphins without skis....
Terry!  You okay?
Tina Wilcox.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
The wind drift is lateral.
What about sailing?
But first, a little juice....
How much longer?
We'll be over by the lighthouse.
I don't care.
What about me?
I want Fruit Loops!
Michael....
Why don't you take a rest, Brian?
Don't feel bad.
He's going with you, Doctor.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
Thank you.
Pre-opening jitters.
My imagination isn't that good.
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
They're coming with us?
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Michael...
Fine piece of engineering.
Change your mind?
Recovering nicely.
Mmmm... you smell good.
No, we'll go through here.
It's too soon to move him.
Yes, you can.
Put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Nobody told me.
They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
I'm sorry.
Philip.
I've heard of a White that big, in Australia...
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
I think they'll come out now.
He's a young one.
Musclehead?
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
You were great out there!
Herpes?
Sean, do you have herpes?
Besides that.
Come on, it's fun!
No...  It can't be.
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Yes, there is goes.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
Polar bears.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Well, Dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  Is there any chance you and Kathryn will get married in Amity?
You want to show this?
Thea....
Where are you going?
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
It sure is good to be home....
Turn it off....
Close the door.
Sweetheart....
Where is she?
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
You want to try your hand at something...?
Sweet breezes...Sweet women....
They won't kill it....
I hope the man knows what he's doing....
I see what you're doing....
We don't want any....
The fish.  Check it....
I almost forgot....
You're damn right I'm serious....
I didn't mean to start that....
I'll be all right, Michael.
Nothing out of the ordinary....
It's late....
Promise me you'll be all right....
Flies the plane....
It was no accident....
Depends on where you want to go....
How can you just take the plane like this?
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
How do you like flying?
I'm fine.
You promised me a drink....
The kind with an umbrella in it....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
You sure you don't need glasses?
I hope she's a good sailor....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
The damn thing is going to have our asses....
Matt?
Yeah....
Still tagging conch?
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
When I invited you...
Okay...we got it together....
You sure you've done this before?
What are we getting out of this old bucket?
Bring her to starboard.
We lost it....
'A Moray eel....'
Holy Christ....
All the time....
I'll do it, Jake.
Jake.
More beautiful with each passing minute...
She's in management....
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
The van?
Did you bring it with you?
Be my guest. What you got?
I dunno .. Guess the dozer musta shifted him? You need some hands up here to look ..
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
Yeah, he can go ...
What does that mean?
What time is it?
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
What do you mean?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
Why?
What are you doing, Ross? I've had that 15 years! ..
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
Why's she blind, Bro?
You gotta stop calling Los Angeles .. You're dragging L.A. around with you like an addiction.  Look at the shit you're putting yourself through? For what? For <u>nothing</u>, I know it, I been there. Remember me? Up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  If there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. Let somebody else worry about it. You gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
What exactly you doing, John?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
I'm talking, outside the girl?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
So read it! You just hung a target around her neck!
He's offerin you a deal? Why don't you take it ..
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
No.
The elevator wasn't working?
Can I see your hands?
No.
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
I have to talk to you, Helena.
The man who killed Amber is a psychopath. He was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill Rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and I didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason I want you to stay at Margie's - coz I can't protect you here ..
He doesn't need my help.
I think they're gonna arrest me.
Interview over, Blattis ...
Then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? Till we do I don't want no one worrying about ..
You think John would like it?
I'm not giving him <u>Pizza</u>. I haven't seem him for a year? I'm gonna cook him a dinner.
You want something, darling?
She married some English prick.
You think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? I was a big-city cop too. And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer. I know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how I know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Now.
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Didn't hear it.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
It's all going to work.
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Oh my God.
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
Truth?
Well.
Yeah, I did.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Maybe you should call her.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
First you gotta tell me something.
What happened to Denver?
I'm sorry, I --
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
You love me now, don't you?
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
I'll get you some quick work --
Then you gotta have The Talk.
You never had The Talk, did you?
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
You don't want to go home, do you?
I think so.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
I'll go back to them.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
I'm fine.  What's up?
You said "fuck".
I won't tell.
Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors. Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2, the Nile...
He says it's a bad idea!
How much weight have you lost?
What did you say!
That's him. Thats Eric!
I don't remember
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
PAUL!
How was your trip? Profitable?
Absolutely not.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
We need to keep moving.
Anything good?
You remember the sounds they made?
Good luck with the fund raising.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
Know what this is?
Why?
Bonitas.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Billy!
I got a call from a gentleman who's going to Costa Rica, or thereabouts. If he's to be believed, it's a most, uh, unique expedition.  And very well-funded.
You are an academic.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
And let's forget about the high hide. We can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Well, is he?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What is?
Do you think the rex might have the infant with it?
Their what?
No way.
Do you see any family resemblance here?
We can't stay in here!
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
-- way we could safely --
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
You've got to be kidding.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
How many lines of code are there?
Doctors, if you please - - I have to insist we get moving.
Imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  Seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
They are?  I'll be damned.
Sure.  I've got a gas powered jeep.  I can drop her at the visitor's center before I make the boat with the others.
Malcolm's okay for now.  I gave him a shot of morphine.
Postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  Velociraptor?
Anything else, you old fossil?
Why would they care what we think?
The movement!
You've got a T-rex!?  He's got a T-rex!  A T-rex!  He said he's- -
So what are you thinking?
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Okay, I'm on channel two.
No. We can't.
God creates dinosaurs.  God destroys dinosaurs.  God creates man.  Man destroys God.  Man creates dinosaurs.
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
Alan, listen to this.
Unpredictability....
Faster!  Shit, shit, shit, faster!
You're telling me that we're facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and Hammond couldn't even be bothered to see me?
Up and down, up and down!
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
'Course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
What do you call a blind dinosaur?
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
Where does he think he's going?
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Can't you stop these things?!
Yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. They viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
Liar!  You said you wouldn't leave!
It's safe.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
I like cows.
Let's go!
Shhhh.  Tim, I'm right here below you.  Easy catch. One, two, three.  You count it yourself.  One, two, three - -
You'll have to get use to Dr. Malcolm!  He suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
I don't think there's been any debate.  There's no debate...my mistakes....
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
Chain saws.
I think we're lost.
I didn't think there were any houses up here...
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Other guy?
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
I can't wait to hear your opening argument.	"Ladies and Gentlemen	of the Jury... the Defense will prove that Jason Voorhees did not kill all of these people. They, in fact, committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard..."
What's going on?
You watch this garbage?
Well?
He wets the bed?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
If we could prove that Jason suffers from this disorder... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition...
Fascinating.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
You know how to use one of those?
We're down to seven minutes.
You work in the insurance department?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
You look like brothers.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Just what you've published.
I read the one about the penal colony.
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
A true friend would do it.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
You wanted to see me, sir.
-- Eduard --
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
What's funny?
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you still maintain -- what? That he was murdered.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
You think what we're doing is so wrong?  And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness?  For what?  To answer to some supreme tribunal?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Where you've been employed for seven years.
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
For all your incompetence I was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me.  You're very good ham actors.
... Why take me into your confidence?
That's <u>mad</u>.
... A piece of paper ...
Women are all you have on your mind!
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
This is filed incorrectly!
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Where do I charter a boat?
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
Look, I've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
I tell you it doesn't exist!
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
What was it, Jack?
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Guess!
Do you always have to repeat?
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
Why isn't he locked up?
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
What is it?
What about?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
You said it was!
It's kind of late.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
You could help me find her. You know the people.  I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
Where, how?
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Some mistake perhaps that --
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
I've always respected Bree.  I'd like to make something clear.
OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had two other cows --  -- two other girls besides Bree.
No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
We grew up together. Kids.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just dropped out. There's thousands.
Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas about the case --
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Show.
On earth.
Uh, huh...
You're late.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Then eat around it.
Is mom ever coming back?
Sleep tight.
Yes?
Are you going to get remarried?
Mom--I mean, dad?
Was there Burger King?
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Sustained.
And would you describe those years as happy?
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
So do I.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
Is that...permanent?
I was not a failure.
I consider it less my failure than his.
Hello, Ted.  You look well.
I've seen him.
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--
Hey, what's the rush?  C'mon, walk me a couple of blocks.
'Night, Jim.
What the hell is this?
Yeah?
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
What?
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
What if I fight it?
You ever see her talk to the walls?
How many?
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Two.  She is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it.  Thelma, do you know where I could be in this business if I had a wife that entertained or went out socially--
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
Please, come, Holiness.
I do, now.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
With much bloodshed.
Ngabo did not have the state seal. He could not sign.
Holiness?
Your father had been very sick.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
Can I save the sheep from going to the market? So they don't die.
Do I have money?
How big is Tibet's army?
Will we be in this war?
Tell me.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
America, we shall see.
Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa.
I am scared.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
I want to go down there.
I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
You have grown up very good.
You are unharmed?
Hmm.
Much too young.
You killed him.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
I might get a shot.
Around here.  Yeah.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Promise you won't kill me, first.
No!
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
No way.
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Where is he?
<u>Did</u> you want to be killed by it?
Excuse me?
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
You're gonna be okay.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
And even if they <u>did</u>, I doubt <u>he</u> or <u>she</u> would have problems with <u>tents</u>.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
What are you doing?
That was an awful thing to say to me.
You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
What?
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
He's mooing.
He's through fighting.  Look at him.
Get him onto shore.
Well...
Different worlds, Jack.
Half mile up, there's a clearing.
Yes.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
Nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  Teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
What?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
You're sort of a rude person.
What?
Hey!!
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
What is this?
Hank?
Are you okay?
I had a great time last night. Again.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
What do you expect, mugging me from behind?
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
<u>You</u>?
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
Myra.
You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon?
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
Wear it, don't ever leave it in your purse. Dry fire it whenever you get the chance. And do your exercises.
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
Now. I want your full attention, Starling. Are you listening to me?
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Miggs has been murdered.
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
Are you finished?
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
You seem pretty sure of that.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would.  I have to go to Belvedere.
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
I have no doubt of it.
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
They all were.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Thank you, Clarice.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
Senator Martin...! You can't trust Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. It's such a game with these people. They're determined to get the arrest for themselves. The "collar," I think they say.
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
The Ottawa are gone.
"We're a breed apart and we make no sense"...?
Will you go back to England?
Where will we go?
My letter...
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
You do not know what you are saying!
You still have an aversion to the water?
One called Magua arrived.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
Then what?
Any powder?
Will you men help us stop the French?
You do what you want with your own scalp.  Do not be tellin' us what to do with ours.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro go free and take the fire out of the English anger over the murder of their helpless ones.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
Yes, sir.
This is the signature of Webb.  And I know the temper of our men. Rather than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end.
First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Yes.
Gold could be arranged.
Yes.
Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua?
Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father?
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
Le mot d'ordre?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Doc eat already?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
I thought they were your friends?
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Your suit, Becky!
Huh?  I...uh...uh...
Sixpack?
We're on backup air.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
Something wrong, Cobb?
How do you feel, DeJesus?
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Forty-eight hours!
Made your million, yet?
You got money in this tub?
Bullshit.
So that's all you do?...
Yeah?  How'd the kid hold up?
What's going on?
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
Clear for pickup.
What is it?
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet Harry is a man you pay if you owe.
Bacon, see what we got.
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
Well?
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
Like what?
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
There are no others.
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Nope.
Mind your language in front of my boy.
You all right back there, mate?
Yeah?
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.
Dog, I have found the cash!
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?
Yeah, one of them's out.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?
J, what's going on out there?  Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.
And all your friends, there's a good lad.
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?
That's it all done, we are off.
Who's this fat man, then?
Tom?
You got it all?
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.
That you, boy?
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
I can't help you, Plank.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
Look. Go on, look.
What have you come as?
How many feet?
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
--you're going to be on your own.
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Because it's a job?
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
So you knew this young man before?
Report to Dr. Innis at the clinic.
Sam the Man.
A .45--
What's that for?
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
You still going to all the home games?
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
You've been in this house for a while?
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
Same as they done in Mexico.
Well--
Tanks, huh?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
This place, the one across the street, four other ones around Ciudad Leon-- soy el Rey de las Llantas. King of the Tires. Lots of your people rollin' back over that bridge on my rubber.
Something like that.
Cliff--
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
It's a .45.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
That where he was shot?
So.
Right.
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Eladio Cruz.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
Senora Cruz?
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
Your mother was a saint.
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
Never heard from him again?
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
And Buddy was one of them.
Morning, Hollis.
You thought any more about our murder?
Charley Wade.
Fellas.
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
Steve called for you.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
Thank you.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
I don't think you can take it personally--
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
What?
You got in late last night.
How come?
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
He's all yours.
Your mother still doesn't like me.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
People liked him.
Nice-looking kid.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
I mean what did we know about anything?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
Wow.
How long have you lived here?
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape--
They got telephones.
You're the one who's a good boy. Man say "fetch" and you fetch--
You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up--
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
I know you?
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
Mister D'Amour?
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Thanks, Billy.
You did.  Didn't you?
Who did this?
I don't want him getting in the way.
I'll tell you.
If you've lied to me to me --
Jesus.  Valentin.  What did you do to your face?
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
Do you wish him to be amongst us?
He's with us...
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
Sorry.  You asked.
Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight?
He's good.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
So why did you marry him?
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
Nothing's going to happen to you.
I was so afraid.
Are you all right?
...yes?
What about me?
... they believe you.
What makes you so sure?
Are you finished with me?
You believe that?
They weren't worth a damn.
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
Then what do you want?
Why'd you come here?
What for?
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
D'Amour --
Don't bother.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
Harry D'Amour.
He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
Call me tomorrow.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
What do you do?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Not really. How long are you here for?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie Brown.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Charlotte, who?
Really?
I don't remember.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
Yeah? But look at you.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
No one ever tells you that...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Do you ever see him?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
So, where'd you go today.
When are you leaving?
I'm going to miss you.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Do you like massage?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Uh, no.
You know, eat healthier.
Hello?
It's ok.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Great.
How'd it go today?
No, what are you talking about.
Yeah.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Oh no...
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
What?  That's horrible!
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
I found them in your file box.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
...you wearing a watch, Father?
Seemed...on edge.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
It's the patient's request, doctor.
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
What is it?
You raised me, like a son.
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
Two negatives always make a positive.
May I help you?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
I'll bet.
So...what did you think of the tape.
So what'd I miss?
I don't understand what's going on.
Yes, I know.
So what?
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
Are you alright?
What do you mean?
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
Good seeing you again.
Maya?  What do you mean?
You know what?  You can go.
Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
He can see you Thursday.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
What do you mean by that?
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
What's the matter with you?
Thanks again for everything.
What happened?
What?
Hi.
There you go.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Okay.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
I can take it.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
A horse?
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
I told him you looked like me.
You ever been in love?
You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
So how come you could play basketball?
I don't know.  A lot.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
I think we gotta kiss now.
A ride home.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
That's it, give it your best shot.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
See you made it.
It's okay, little baby.
That was so weak.
Give me the ball.
I...can't.
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Who was that?
You weren't at my game.
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
Never had to.
What?
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
So that's it, just forget about us?
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
Funny.  I never did.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
So...how's the knee?
It just isn't.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
You asked me what was missing.
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
What will this prove?
So?
And what happens when you lose?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
Give it yourself.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
What?
What is this?
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
How was your game?
Still the man.
Just...leave it alone.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
Why?
Lucky kid.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
Your teeth are straight.
You ok?
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
What the fuck do you want?
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
FUCK YOU.  FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Please put your clothes on, please --
Yeah.
Yeah.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
You take cream or sugar?
Ok, ok. I'm back.
Just Jim.
Please, yes.
Great, bye.
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
So you've done it --
You wanna make a deal with me?
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
-- you the resident here?
No, what's wrong?
Where's the news department at this studio?
Can you hold it?
Let's go, c'mon, get up --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
DAD --
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
Phil, hang in just one more minute ok?  I'm gonna put you on hold -- Doc you still there?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
Do you have love in your heart?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
But you're alright now, so what's the what?
Picky, picky.
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
You see?
I paid you back.
Braces?
I need to sit down.
Get a girlfriend.
And do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...Where's Linda?
...I can't hold onto this anymore...
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
All it takes is one second?
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
She lived in Tarzana.
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Where does that name come from?
It's not your given name, right?
And "Frank?"
Are you asking me a question?
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
You can't just come in here.
There's no disturbance.
I don't have to answer your questions.
No.  I said that.
I live alone.
No I Said.
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
Been drinkin' today?
What the hell is this Marcie?
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Will you say my name?
Are you ok?
Willa Cather.
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
Come home soon after the show.
Did you tell her?
I don't think I want that.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
Two years...three years...
It's over becuase...for all the the right reasons I hope, what I said.
What? No, Rose, jesus, no --
Hello?
I'm Bob.
Can I come in?
I'm sorry.
We're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
I can't.
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Partridge?
Yeah.
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
..sorry...
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
What is that?
....what the fuck, what the fuck....
Anne...!  I know... I know that to love you is treason against France. But not to love you... is treason against my heart.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
I am preparing for a ball!
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
What had you to do with this, Mother?
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
What is that?
Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
Now.  You were saying?
Where are you going?!
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
Forgiveness.
I observe your forgiveness isn't sweeter than a plump nipple.
You've been moping for months.  Now that you've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way, you can stop boring me and start being useful to me.  Now get some rest.
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
Aramis... These are... these are whores!
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Raoul is everything to me.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
Phillippe...?
All this time... I was a lost secret.  But you were hiding all your loyalty, all your love.  You were the Man in the Iron Mask.
But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
I -- I thought he was but... an impostor who resembled --
Continue.
Food, moron.
What number did you tear out?
What number, on the first page?
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
Exactly why it should be given away.
Sire!  I -- How did you --
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Shall I leave?
Captain Doyle?
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
I'm going to look for him on my own. Fuck this.
What did the six-toes have to say?
What's this?
Are you alright?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
I was just having a little fun -
Zydowski.  It's about time.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
Captain?
Where up north?
Look what are you anyway? Some kind of spy?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
Have you ever heard of the Live Oak River?
What?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe.  If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
Where are you going?
No.  It wasn't like that!
Where am I going?
I wouldn't presume to try.
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattler right now.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Where?
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
Why not?
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
You look all right now.
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
...snuck in the hospital while I was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
For Christ's sake, why?
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
There has to be.
He's a very shy boy...
Something Lecktor said.
It does, doesn't it?
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
Can you give me an idea of the conditions...
When do you need it?
I'll take you.
The developing room.  I need to... see you.
Two groups of people were changed. Leeds and Jacobi. The police think they were murdered.  Do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  You can say.
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Do you see?
Do you know something about that?
He's very strong physically.
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
He asked how you are.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Is Crawford going with you?
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson?
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
It's a precaution...  Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float.
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
Are you gonna kill him?
She got all right?
And Hobbs died?
Did you get my card?
Why should I tell you?
What disadvantage?
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
I don't believe in God.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin' out here!!
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
Andy?
Andy!
You're so proud.  You're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"
They're having a laugh...
Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  Demand a recount...
You must take a little pleasure in it.
Andy, you're surrounded by what you create.  You are the KING of negative energy.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
Really?
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Andy... we don't want the viewer to get out of their chair.  They might change the channel.
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
Cue the commercial!
What do you mean?
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Popcorn?
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
And all this will be for real?
Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
I dunno about this...  What will my mother think?
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
I, I was asked to do this material - -
Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
It's probably just a strained muscle.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
That was a really hot house!
So you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  You... and you.
I saw Michael!
What's in Memphis?
You don't know.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
You got the money?
I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
You weren't supposed to relieve me.
You don't, do you?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
He had an accident.
Goddamn you, Cypher!
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
Thanks... for the drink.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Yes.
What is he doing?
What the fuck do they want with me?!
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
Ironically, this is not far from the truth.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
When?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
Do you know why you didn't make it?
So is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
What did she tell you?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
Tank.
We need an exit.
Tank, charge the E.M.P.
Hello?
Yeah.
My name is Trinity.
How did you do that?
Of what?
It's the question that brought you here.  You know the question just as I did.  It is a hacker's question.
Uh-oh...
Did you go to her?
What did you just say?
Is Morpheus alive?
That I would have to make a choice...
What?
Neo, how did you do that?
It's a city?
How much time?
When it does, Morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
Tank, you're hurt.
What just happened?
Know where he is?
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
Hey hold it!  Gimmie the cash.
See what I mean?  A question please...'Is this what you call living?'
So?
Nervous?
Hey, come on...
Panther...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Drinks for everybody Tony...
It's the truth, I swear.
Nah.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
Shut up!
Your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  We've been in here calling...
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
Don't you move!!!
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
I can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Hey, shut up.
Be seeing you and Johnny tonight... here...right?
Where's the rest?
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
Oh yes, he's pretty good.
His whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
Take your time.  I don't care.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
You know why...with my parents.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Yeah, it's your father's.
That was 'Joe'.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
What is this?
Oh, the goddam party --
I haven't been the father to you that --
I wasn't going to say --
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Honey --!
...This shit's not bad.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
Hello, Beautiful.
We have an arrangement now.
I didn't say.
May I interrupting?
No.
Perhaps you could remind me.
No, I don't --
Good morning, Drew.  Thanks for coming out.
'Yes'.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
It's going to be great --
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
Is there any more to it?
Have we met?
Shall we adjourn?
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
Whose?
That's it?
In English, please.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news.  As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
Can't, sistah.
I am.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Confused, huh?  About what?
Oh yes, I do.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
Yes?
Oh goodness, no.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
Almost.
I'm sorry about --
Thank you.
Did you like making love to me?
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
The 'coffee shop' --
Susan --
You think so?
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
What a good idea.
When you go, I go.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
I'm not everybody.
I want to live.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Now I'd like to be alone.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
About Susan?
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
What's okay?
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
And I don't give a shit.
You are?
What the hell do you care?
You're what?
Those were my words, Bill.
I don't like what you're saying.
An offense --
Not exactly.
Yes.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
I think you know --
Please.  Talk to me --
'The one' to do what?
I'm sorry --
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
This one.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry?  I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
Don't get carried away.
That's for me.  I'm talking about you.  It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Daddy, what's the matter?
That was wonderful.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
Then what is it?
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
Daddy --
What was that?
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
You said you liked me.
47.
66.
Slam it?
So you're holding my calls?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
Shit. Wrong room.
So how many rooms am I checked into in this dump?
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
I haven't made a strong enough impression.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Why?
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
I wasn't helping you for money.
They treating you alright?
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
How do I know he did that to you?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
His name was Jimmy.
What do the police think?
Kill him.
Give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called Teddy.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Who?
What does he want?
Don't talk about my wife.
Yes.
They're not looking for him.
On the house.
A BEER, please.
Chronic alcoholism ~ one cause of short term memory loss.
Lenny, is that you?
It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
I don't think so.
Natalie? Natalie who?
We've got to get him out of here.
We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding.
Why's that?
What do you mean "bad news"?
Guys who'll come after her. Guys who'll want to know what happened to her boyfriend. They'll want to make somebody pay. Maybe she'll try and make it you.
What sort of questions?
I didn't sell -
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
How'd you know I was in here?
How do you know this?
You're not coming?
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
You won't remember!
Why would I do that?						    *
Your name's Teddy.
Bullshit.							*
And...?
With Sonny.  110%.
They'll kill Gina.
Where's the new drop point...?
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
You need to consider a few issues.
Sure.
So...?
My end?
Make it 40%.
How fast does that go?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs.  You cannot be armed.  If you're carrying, it has to go.  Or stow it inside.  No one will go near your boat...
Were you born in Havana?
I insist.
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Is it December?
Available cash is not an issue for us...
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Jos...
Yeah.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
Yeah?
How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
So?
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?
Havana, Cuba...?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Hey, fuck him.
What is going on...?!
Out of...?
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
On the phone.
C'mon, man!
Who are you talking to?
So?
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
I think Jos suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate.  And people, who are good at what they do?  They have egos, too...
And violence is extra.  And expensive.  So how much weight you looking to move?
Then what were we talking to you for?
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You ain't coming to work?
What you gonna do back there, East?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
He's got taxi fare.
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?
For money.
I'm a hustler, hell, didn't you know that?
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
Hey, listen, how about you take me to mee this Mister O'Diddle bird right now?
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
You don't seem like no fag...
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
I want you to stay, okay? I goddam invited you, didn't I?
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
You get your first palm tree in South Carolina.
Sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago. There was this war, there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die. But he didn't. Isn't that amusing?
What you got me up here for?
I'm going to Florida.
Here. Don't even thank me.
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
Get lost.
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?
Getchmis olsun
It's there!
What?
To what?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Haps, railroad, bus timetables?
DAD!
You know where they are?
Those mountains? are they?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
Got a family back there?
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
Just Erich.
Feeling all right?
You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
No... It looks like your going to have a new court.
What time is it?
We go back.
Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me.  That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.
What?
...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  If we knew where he hid it.  Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere.
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Know what?
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
Lawyers?
Hey, you can't...
Jeremy...
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
You really love flashing that thing, don't you?
There are thirty five listed in the reverend Wong's roster...
Peter...
And a right.
The Department of Public Health...
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Did you see the size of that thing?!
Its muscles are locked.
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
Is there a switch?
What do you-?
What are you putting that crap on me for?
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
No, Jesus, no.
It's no use! They know we're in here!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
Talk to me.
Hello.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Not a big one.  I mean, it was like a turkey baster.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
My God.
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
Sure.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
What's it about?
But what?
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
Done?
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
Then who did?
See, isn't this nice?
Misery's Return?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
I guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.
Paul, you're dripping with perspiration, your color is very hectic--what have you been doing?
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
Paul, this is positively the best Misery you've ever written.
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
Did I do good?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
Yes.
Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks.
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they're both raves. And don't laugh--for the first time, I think you've got a shot at some prizes.
Where is it?
Afraid he's got no choice.  I believe I broke his jaw.
Not much luggage.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
You won.
You picked another winner!
God damn it, Nyah!  Why did you do it?  Why did you save that bastard?
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
There it is, guys, the last of it.
Not exactly.  Wallis?
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Before we kill her or cure her..
There she is.  I got visual.
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
How're we doin', then?
Do you know me?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
Where's the bloody -
May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
So where did I got right?
Someone in possession of all the facts.  Are you telling me I have to do this?
You don't trust me.
Have you met them?
Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
And then what?
Very.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
I don't know, but Nekhorvich was not a manic.  Get me a twenty on Nyah.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
You have Bellerophon.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
You asked for my help.  You <u>asked</u> for <u>my</u> help...come on...
But why tell us?
What kind of show.
Dont Jim.
Is he serious?
I'm walking.
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
Where were you?
What are you going to do?
I just need you to be safe.
Two cars.  Where are you?
Are you damaged?
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
Krieger <u>did</u> have the NOC list.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
It's quite out of the question.
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
Why should I?
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
What was your deal with Job?
You're not going to any meeting without me.
Claire.
Jack.  Jack.
I thought I'd take some now.
Tell you what?
You're going to use Walter?
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
Ive got a shadow.
Whats going to make him do that?
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
Arent you going to thank me Jim.  Ten million is better than six.
Sorry Ethan.  Times up.  Say goodbye.
Jim, its over.
Such a nice ass.
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Yes...  Its him.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
I don't like him.
Rita. Pass the wine.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Rose, pass the wine.
Where's Ma?
You're not sleepy?
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
What are you doing here?
You're married.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
Why you looking around so much?
It's wrong to just let them go.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Have you come from my brother?
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
That's it.
You don't have to help me.
This is good. Uhh...
When your husband get hit by the bus?
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
It's so bright.
What? What have we done?
I'm telling you you can't.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
No thanks.
What's the matter?
You're making me feel guilty again.
I'm here!
I'm freezing to death.
He's coming.
Hi Loretta.
You don't want the fish.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Are you proposing marriage to me?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Yeah.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
So we'll sell the house.
Did he tell her?
Hi.
I don't wanna talk about it.
What? He's in Sicily!
He's with his dying mother!
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
He should pay.
So.
Who was that?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
No idea.
I'm sure she did.
May I presume to ask you a question?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
Thanks, comrade.
Yes.
People home.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
That's my house.
She's got it.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Burn her anyway.
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
King of the WHO?
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
What, "is"?
A scratch?  Your arm's off.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Hello.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Now what happens?
Ni, ni, ni!
Ni!
What manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder?
What?
Look, you're a busy man ...
Where?
... You silly sod.
:I'm thirty-seven ... I'm not old.
Well you could say: "Dennis"
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
Well?
... Um ... Yes ... no ... a bit ... yes... she has got a wart.
What is your name?
To seek the Grail!
'Ere.  He says he's not dead.
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Who's that then?
Well taken, Concorde!
I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
They cost fifty pounds each!
I don't want land.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
If we ... er ... 
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Yes ...  make sure ...
No, I want you to stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room until I get back.
We are just not used to handsome knights ...  But you are wounded!
Quick!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
You were, Sir Galahad, You were in terrible peril.
No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
I done it again.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
So?
How much?
It's only grief makes her like she is.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
The place is a mess.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
Do you know who you address, sir?
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
Checked and locked, sir.
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
They're ready now.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
I was told you were in a fight.
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
What can we do?
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
A fine choice, sir.
Erysipelas.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Unwell?
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.  The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Who told them that?
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
What do they want?
What do you mean?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Nick, Alex, how are we today?
Now what seems to be the problem?
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Has anyone seen Greg?
Sick?
What's her problem?
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
No, in person.  Now.
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.
It is.
Then leave her.
Virgin sacrifices?
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay?
Jesus Christ!
You don't get it, do you?
You feel it?  It's different this time.
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
The clock's already ticking.
We can't reach that!
Christ...no time...
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Then we'll go home?
Which way?
It's the wrong way!
It's here!!!
What did he do to you?
I'm thinking!
So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies?
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
It will work out.
I understand.
Yes...what is it?
... What??
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Betty Elms?
Was anyone hurt?
No.
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
I don't know.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
"You're still here?"
"So... surprise"...
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
"Before I kill you."
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
Don't stop!
No... but...
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.
You see what I mean...
Sammy thinks the Caddy had stopped along the shoulder ... man up the road said he saw two cars drag racin'...then you got that blind corner.
Yeah, they showed me
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
The one of 'em still alive?
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
No.  I haven't seen any.
Good morning. What do you have today ?
Where are we ?
Why should we trust you ?
What about Matt ?
Come on, it works.
So what do we do ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
What are you doing ?
Why did you build this whole place ?
He hired you to build this place ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
I... I .....
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
Are you Matthew Parker ?
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
An elevator ?
You okay ?
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
When you are ready.
You did.
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
I propose we consider a hostile take over. Perhaps Ol' Bruce is in need of a new job opportunity.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
How long till the drug wears off ?
Bruce has just awaken.
What is Bruce doing ?
What's next ?
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
Are you okay ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Are you okay ?
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Do you still teach?
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Visualize a spare?
So, what's on your mind?
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
I already bought a ticket.
Hi honey.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
What happened to Shelly?
Can I see him?
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
Reason? What reason?
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
Sure am, who are you?
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
I told you it was a long story.
Do you have any pictures if her?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
Hi.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Vada?
But we made a business deal.
There's water in your bathroom.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Just come and get it...right here!
It's dangerous!!
My mother stood on this very spot.
Right.
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
Yeah?
An adventure?
Wow!
No problem.
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
But...are you engaged or something?
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
Maybe.
A secret, I like that.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
Then you'll be all set.
He was caressing.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Good morning.
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Did it hurt a lot?
Hey, you didn't pay me!
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
Keep your voice down!
The boss is watching us...
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Can't you see it?
Stiffs??
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
Hi.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Does it make it easier to win?
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
I haven't danced in.....
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Did you ahh, love him?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
When?
I fall asleep at the wheel.
What are you doing.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
What was my mama like?
Do you miss her?
Well well well, what's going on in here?
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
What do you get for that?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Do you like her?
Really?
Who's winning?
Did you read ALL these books?
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
I won, I won!!!
NO!
Daddy??!?!?!
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
Thomas J?
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Hurry!
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Naah, I don't wanna.
Hey look at this!
No, I don't wanna.
Is that your Dad?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Sorry.
Pacifist!
Bed wetter!
What do you want it for anyway?
Jump in the water!!
Hi Vada.
I do, she's real funny.
Say something it's too quiet.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
You flew all the way h...
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
Elmer's Glue?
You're going to say it, aren't you?
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
Don't you have to be somewh...
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
And the answer was so simple.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
For the twins? What in the world is th...
So... one almost has to...
Exactly what?
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
You're not eating.
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
Big weddings are so strange.
You miss her, huh?
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
This thing means that much to y...
Michael? What ha...
Thank God you were here.
Uh.  I saw that moving...
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Why would she come here...
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
Because I could come...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
What?
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
No.
Barnett, please -
You have to what?
Am I disturbing you?
I said, I've been real tired.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
She's fine.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
His Word.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
Well, how about the shopping center?
Okay, then we'll see you there.
Hi. I'm John Triplette.
National television?
It's an appearance. It has nothing to do with support. I don't even like him.
Howdy.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
Didn't you get?... How are you?
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
Who's that?
You must really like him.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Well, can you tell me why?
Do you ever do any writing?
I'm not sure. Where?
What?
Oh?
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
Stay.
How old are you?
My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
What time?
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
Why?
You want a ride into town?
It's not bad.
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
Don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
You got something you want to do?
Looked like an interview to me.
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
Who isn't?
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Say something.
You ready, Donut?
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
What I'd like to do---
Manson beat you.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
I could go for a Coke.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Yes.
I admire them.
Hypnotizing.
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
Yes.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
You can't be serious?
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
Are you all set?
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
It's gonna be beautiful.
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
I see.
Ya know, I was.
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Two guys?
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
I said: Cut it out!
What's the matter, boy? Never smile?
She done moved to Detroit.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
How 'you doing?
His profession?
And his age?
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
How 'you doin' man?
Your folks live there?
My father's the preacher.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Hell!
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
How come you stay 'round here?
What?
Ain't your fault.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
I'll have some coffee, please.
Don't push me, Duff.
What about him?
My kids want me to teach them.
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
How come you keep askin'?
Don't deny me, Duff.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Hi.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Where're you going to go?
Where' you goin'?
A whole lot, Frankie.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
I guess you'll be making' some changes 'round here.
No.
Take it easy, Pop.
Couldn't get the words out before.
What did you say, boy?!
How often does he get like that?
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
How 'you gonna live?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Well, if it ain't Duff!
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
Let's stay here, Will.
Whoa.  No way.  You can't enter the kill zone.
So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
Take this off.
What about her?
Alright. Let's talk business.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
Then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
Yeah, well it's working.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
You've got your orders.
The access code to your mainframe.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
I saw your girl yesterday.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
I'm surprised you still are. Should'a told me you had an A.I. running probes at you.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
What?
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
It'll flatline your ass.
Take a look. Son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
This thing's loaded with internal virus systems. You'll fry like an egg in there.
Hello, Case.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
What is it?
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
Maybe something's onto him.
I gotta know... did it work>
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
Shit...
Like what?
Get up.
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
You're Pam?
Guess who I did it with last night...
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
How about this?
What is this?
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
You've done five of my ideas.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
Gus?
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Oh my god.
You having fun?
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Josie Grossie.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
You're twenty-three years old!
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
Hi, everyone.  I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Whoa. Deja Vu.
I love the way she writes.
Sure, why?
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
You have to say that. You're my student.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
Yes.
You ruined the whole thing!
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
By name.
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
He sure is big, Jack...
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
Yes.
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
Taste it.
<i>                                          ... You're no fun.</i>
I told you I want that room unpacked.
Help me with this thing!
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
You two got a thing going, or what?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
Look, you got electricity in your body, right?
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
Anything?
About not finding any bogey men?
What is it?
You want to talk about it?
We're going up to bed now.
I'm serious.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.
What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
Nancy?  Would you sit with me awhile?
Freddy?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Max, where's Kristen?
You need me, I'll be here all night.
Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
It's over.  It's over.
That's what I know.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
I can't believe I just did that.
To who?
Stop blaming yourself.
Take us there, Kristen.
Oh Christ.  Simms put Kristen in the Quiet Room for the night.  They sedated her.
I'm Taryn White.  I only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  Also, I guess 'cause I'm going through some very stange shit.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
That's enough, Kincaid.
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
We're here.
That was such a great evening.
And then I... right.
Coffee?
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Hi.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
Okay -- fine.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
Why?
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Cartwright.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Can I stay a bit longer?
I don't know what happened.
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
You were saying...
Sorry about that.
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
Yes...
Excuse me.
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?
Yup.
Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
Bella -- this is Anna.
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Hello, Bernie.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
By the way -- it's you.
Yes.  What do you think?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- I once saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think it was Ringo.  It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,' Toppy.
That's right -- Topol.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
Do you ever masturbate?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
Oh God no.
No, sir.
No, sir.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
I'll talk to you in the morning.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
What's going on?
How was she?
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
Get up, Billy.
Is there anything else?
Yeah, you ain't half so bad looking for a head nurse.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
In ya go...
Say... God Bless America!
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
In there.
What for?
Yeah, Mack?
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
When do you think we'll be going back, Mack?
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
I'll bet a dollar.
And how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
Okay, sucker.
I said out!
Let me see your hand!
Big king, too bad...
Hit me!
Oh, what's that?
Poker!
Well, ya know, Doc...  Doesn't it say so there?
Doc, what can I tell ya?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
It's just medication, Mister McMurphy, good for you. Now down it goes...
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
Yeah, buddy?
Up an' at 'em, Taber.
Somebody's coming!
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
Hey, how ya doin'?
Sure, she understands what you mean. She's not dumb. Why do you think Rose came to visit us? Rose is very interested in hospitals and hospital facilities. Aren't you, Rose?
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
Bet!
Hey, Billy, stop cryin'. You don't have to cry... You ain't got nothin' to be ashamed of. She ain't gonna tell you mother... stop crying...
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
Whew! Hiya, boys!
What happened?
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
She was your sister.
Your grandmother?
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
Excuse me?
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
Were they pen pals?
What?...
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
We found each other, didn't we?
I'm a liberal!
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
No.
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
You...
It was the moth stuff that gave it away, didn't it?  I knew that was too much.
Hello?  Is anybody there?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Where are you going?
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
That's not the point.
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Why are you asking me this?
Why not?
He's out by the pool right now.
Nice dress.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
Hi.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
Is something the matter?
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
What would you call it?
Very funny.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Hello.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Sure.
I'll look forward to it.
Excuse me?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
How about the other one?  His friend.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
What's he do?
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
Your brother?
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
What did you say to her?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
I never even got to be single.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Joan Collins stayed here.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
I'm gonna take her home first.
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
Well, where are they?
Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
It'll do.
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
I wish I knew.
Working hard?
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
What the hell!!!
See! You don't understand!
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
Terry...?
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
The Golden Warriors.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Listen, you like beer?
Want to go out and have one with me?
No thanks... .
Were you really a prize fighter?
Now what are you doing?
And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea?
Why, Terry, who said it was?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
Because... because...  Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.
Edie... Edie... ..
Terry what's happening to you?
Don't tell me don't tell me!
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
You're all packed.  And here's your bus ticket. You're on your way back to St. Anne's.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
You can!
D 'n D?
You all right, Nolan?
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys 
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again.  Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
Didn't you recognize him, dopey. That's Old Man Doyle.
Boy, you must've been up early.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
What's wrong with your shoulder?
Terry?  What do you want?
Well I got to watch myself these days. Know what I mean?
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
Tippi-tippi-tim, tippi-tim, Tippi-tippi-tan, tippi-tan...  Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker?
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
Maybe I will one of these days.
Leave her alone, you fiend!
Your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters, but it certainly doesn't hurt your art of kissing.
In there.
Can't we get out of here?
What do you mean?
Look!
What can we do?
She came to us on the Day of the Dead.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
I understand, Master
The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
We don't know of anything, Master...
Then it is some service you desire of us.
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
He called the day he escaped.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Ask him his name.
Adele?  You in there?
It's Richard Ripley.
Do we need him?
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
Oh, man.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
What?!
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Nice disguise.
You at least bring the gun?
Whatta you think?
Outside of that.
You know they gonna set us up.
You ever wear one of these?
What?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
We made it, didn't we?
Hello, Daniel.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
What'd you talk about?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
I have to qualify, is that it?
We'll talk another time, Karen.  All right?  I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
Shut up.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Sure, Daniel.
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Karen, I told you not to--
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Who's sitting here?
The fuck you talking about?
You got two minutes, that's all.  Make up your mind.
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
Good luck, Richard.
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Why you're just a girl.  What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too.  Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
You don't seem all that scared.
You don't act like it.
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
None of your business.
Think I could have them back?
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
Why not?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
You really wear that suit.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
You know I saw you on the street.
You coming back?
You're not dumb.
Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
So.  What's your point?
You think he's lying?
Take your sunglasses off.
She <i>knew</i> me from some bullshit dope bust.  She drove me to court.  Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike?  "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
Looks like tonight.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage.  You think you're better than that?  Fine.  Show me.  Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better.  But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
Gentlemen.  I think we've calmed down now.  Haven't we, Jack?
Foley?  That you?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
I already stole it.  Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm.  I can't be stealing it again, can I?
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
You there?
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
Hi, Ray.
I can tell.
What's wrong with you?
You like to sit down?
Got run over by a car.
Thanks, Dad.
You were talking in your sleep.
What are you thinking about?
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
Out for the evening?
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Faux goose down.
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
I found a rubber.
You good-lookin' sumbitch...don't you EVER die!
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.
Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform?
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
Nervous?
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Sorry.
I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
It's tight.
They're all over us!
I got a half a tank.  You?
I'm out of ammo!
Fun today.  Like old times.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
It's not getting any longer.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
Sorry.
So beautiful!
And where's the secret base, Sir?  The one we t-takeoff from.
Now we have fifteen requests for the Emperor's Palace...and one for Tokyo baseball stadium.
There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible.
Well sure, Colonel --
Listen you guys.  I'm the first plane -- then McCawley, Walker, the rest of you. I'll have the shortest run.  If I don't make it, you don't go.
How'd you get this?
Win?
What do you get for winning?
Oh, this is Betty.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
Fook ya!
You see us as capable of such a blow?
Do you have to wear that hat?
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
Welcome to the singles scene.
We're going to take you home.
I don't get it.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
You got a Tab?
How do you feel?
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
Looking good out there.
Where did you get that sweater?
Charlie, let's make love.
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love  Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
What're you doing here?
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Just take a look at it. 
Oh, Charlie.
Come back to me.
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
It was Beth's idea.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
For me?
I closed my Christmas club.
Yes.
He'll win.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Mom!
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
Sort of.
What happened to you?
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
Would they go over my girdle or under?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes JellO.
Don't eat the red ones.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
You look exactly the same.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
Dancing with you.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
Sort of.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
What're you doing?
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
You're taking advantage of a minor.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and lifestyles.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Hey! Where're you off to?
What are you talking about?
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
Come on, that's just a bullshit story. You said so yourself...
You want me to help?
It's weird...
How did it go with your father last night?
Yes!
What's wrong with your face?
Allright. Calm down.
Drew!
Jerk... What did you say?
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
What's that mean?!
Whatever.
Thanks, Charles.
I know that, Charles.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
My lover and I.
Big trouble.
Rayisha.
One more thing, Your Honor...
Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive...
I'm a law suit.
You survived your first gay party intact.
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
Particularly, Charles.
Except... you were gay?
In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay?
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over.
Rach.
What kind of movies do they show there?
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Some do. I didn't.
Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your fortieth anniversary?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
We're going to draw blood.
Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Explain to me, if you can, Mr. Wheeler, explain this to me like I'm a ten year-old. This trial is not about a disease, is that what you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your understandable, if unfounded, fear of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it? You're saying, this trial is about Andrew Beckett's character. Am I getting this right?
Good school. What year?
Great.
You're the asshole, buddy.
Don't know, Joe.
Joe?
Right.
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
Not when I was in the Navy.
Yeah. But we took care of him.
Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a note of that. Andy didn't lose the complaint in his computer. He never put it in. He lied about that, too.
Don't wanna miss this.
Gonna lose everybody out here....
You came for us....
Tell me that was you.
You did this? To yourself?
Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
Riddick? What the hell are you --
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Step aboard, Carolyn.
Here. Make it easy on you.
You barely know them.
How many bottles?
No, no, I wanted to get away.
Better keep moving....
So now you know.
Didn't bite.
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
How much you weigh, Johns?
How much?
I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
Well? Is it just the pump?
Why did I fall on you?
I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
Fry?
One is all?
Hasan?
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
The sled as a shield....
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
And pointless.
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
Very big beads.
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
Such as.
Aw, this can't be happening to me....
What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
Take it.
How did you know we'd come here?
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
A toy. It floats on the air.  Try it.
One pistol... twenty-four rounds of ammo. two medical kits.. one camera... one TX9.  We've enough food and water for three days.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Hmph.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
He's trying to form words.
All right --
Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
Scarecrows?
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
How so?
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Twelve hundred years ago.
Tell him to pull back!
Then there is another jungle?
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
I'm not acting! I can talk! How much proof do you want?
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
Dr. Zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
Let them talk, Mr President. Let them talk.
Secondly, if these 'tools' as you call them, are unidentified, why are they introduced as 'evidence' of anything?
But the proof? The doll?
...You keep pouring out that suppressing fire, Barnes. I don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Say I can dig it. Smoke that shit everything kinda gets weird y'know?  Y'hear that story the gooks is putting chemicals in the grass so's we become 'pacifists' so's we don fight  Where the hell's everybody, they'se gettin high that's what - bunch of hopheads, they think they special...
Come on you can do better than that!
You lame Taylor?
Where's Lerner?
Come on man!
But what'd she actually do?
Dawn! That was it!
And you, do you believe?
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
'People say I'm the life of the party cause I tell a joke or two although I may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside I'm blue...'
What we got here a crusader?
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Right...
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Vancouver, B.C.
Where are you staying in Vancouver Royal. It's pretty crowded you know.
Indefinitely?
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
Okay. You win.
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
I didn't say anything.
Want a spike in it?
There's a lot of night left to live through.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
Killaine's wise.  We can't wait any longer.  Here, put this on.  But stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I'll tell you when. 
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
Including Killaine...I still can't think of you that way.
Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
It buys things, just like any other kind.
You'll never make it.  You've out- smarted yourself.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Who'd believe it but you?  I took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  Even if they find him, what connects him with me?
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
This is it, Betty.  They'll find us again, fog or no fog.
I think you mean that.
Yes, Miss.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
What are you going to do--toss your job into Puget Sound?  Because I make you think of magnolias?  I thought policeman was something like a soldier.  That his duty came first.  However much he might happen hate it.
What proper grounds?  You can't be in love with me.  You hardly know me.  I'm not in love with you.
Good morning, Mr. Brandon.
Bluff. You've waited too long.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Got it on you?
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
Let me introduce you. Mr.  Killaine, Mrs. West.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?
Who told you my name?
It goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete Englishman.
Somebody Mitchell picked up on the train. I don't even know her name.
Thank you.
Could be.
In case you want to have us followed.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
You'd be breaking the law.
The only answer I have for you.
Information.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
You asked me where it all came from.
Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
I think we'd better discuss this in my office, Mr. Mitchell.
Passkey?
You nasty, sardonic--
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Not a floater.  Only just dead.
Got a moment, Inspector?
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
... I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.
Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
That's pretty risky business, Inspector.
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
May you what?
It does.  May I go now? 
I don't understand.
So far.
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
I've explained the situation to Mr. Mitchell up to a point.  Now about this Mayfield girl?
No.
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
How long have you had it?
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
Terrific.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
I'll have some of that.
Yes...You're not a socialist then?
And you'll join me in a sambucca?
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
What did you think of that Wadja film?
I couldn't bear for it to end.
Oh, but he was terrific.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
Oh yes?
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Why not stay?
Me too.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Shall we have a drink or something?
Now, top secret file.
It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
Hold those rights.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Thanks.
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
What have you got there?
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Ah, Susy, it...
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
One shot stopping.
Ever done this before?
You're a fucking dead man--
Where's Roach?
You gotta tell me where she is.
Why should I?
Three seconds... two... one...
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Good move.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
Angelo!  Don't fire!
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
I... I gotta go.
Bye.
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
Billy... What the hell's wrong with you?
You've been pushing too many Pencils, Dillon. Had enough?
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
You don't know how much I missed this, Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
What story did you give to Davis?
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
You're wastin' your time.
You saw what?
Took 'em out with a heat seeker.
What's he got?
Major, you'd better take a look at this.
What in God's name...?
Georgia.
There's no way you could know that.
We can reach an understanding on this.
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
You don't know anything about me.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock.  On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Stop.  For just a moment.  Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions <u>before</u> you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
Stolen?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
So do day jobs.
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
For the whole night?
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
And why do you say that?
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Not... quite.
Did you buy some clothes?
Just one?  Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
The Rex.
I think you'll approve.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
Was someone rude to you?
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
You still mad at'm?
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Fuck off.
Do I look okay?
I've never been on a plane before.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Right.
Business.
I got tired of hating my father.
At least stay for a drink.  This party's for you.
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
Doing what?
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
I don't think there's any sense in --
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
'Lo.
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Kit...
It was great.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
What kind of school?
You bullshittin' me?
What's your name?
What is it, Miss Vivian?
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
I think you'll find it normal enough.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
They will serve salad.
Then you would use your--
Miss Vivian --
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
No, I'm sorry, I don't.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter.  For no reason!  What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head?  Why?  What was all that benevolent crap?  What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
I bet.  A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
Rest, Highness.
Does it bother you to hear?
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
But how can you be sure?
Singed a bit, were you?
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
You're quick.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
Faster!
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
-hold it, hold it-
Oh no. No, please.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Yes.
Who gets Humperdinck?
What? What?
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Rise and report.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
Could this be a trap?
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Why? You can't even lift one.
Now?
Where's Fezzik?
What? What?
This is noble, sir.  His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
He's dead. He can't talk.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
There's something I ought to tell you.
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
Go in, get after her!
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
You're just stalling now.
What's so funny?
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Please, please, that's what we're here for.  Be careful, that hurt.
Wait a minute.  This is a very big decision.  It might effect the course of my entire life.  I'll have to think about it.  I'll do it.
Wait!  This is Boomerang.  This is Boomerang.
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
What scheme?
What???
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
Well, it's... uh... it's nice and long... I mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
To failure!
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
Well, I... Well, it's just that... I'm sorry I called you fat, fat, fat.
Don't help me.
Get car.  Get car.
Feeling better?
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Wagner...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Okay.
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
What did you tell the people?
Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
No. At least I don't recall.
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
She arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
Very early. Dawn.
No.
She was tired. She said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... Yes, now I'm remembering very clearly because I'm picturing. When you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. She was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
What do you mean?
Cash.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Of course not.
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
No, M'am. I was only about to say, I've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that's all.
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Were there any calls?
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
Forty thousand dollars.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
Yes.
Did he say anything about my sister?
Is something wrong?
What's the matter?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
I ought to call the police right now!
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound. Ever notice, Lila?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
Huh?
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting?
What is it?
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
I wish I were. Not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  Next best thing to no conscience at all.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
You have something most girls never have.
I've caused you some trouble.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
Is your time so empty?
Why do you ask that?
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
Why don't you go away?
An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
I've suggested it myself. But I hate to even think such a thing.  She needs me... and it isn't...  ...it isn't as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it's just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Alright, Miss... 
Is anything wrong?
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
Barefaced.
I'll take you to...
Looking for me?
Yes.
You didn't find anything.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Did you wish to see someone?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
What made you steal? Are you hungry?
I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
Thousands?
Oh, I see. Cats' fur.
What's down there?
What's that?
Your father?
Did you hear?
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
You lie!
Yes, why?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
There's no hurry. It's early.
Why didn't you eat last night?
You wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
But I think these things are beautiful.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
Which one is me? The horse?
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
That's what I said.
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
Hold on, hold on. I'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and I think you are.
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
Why?
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
Is that a fact?
I'm not asking you anything. I'm telling you what I'm going to do!
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Could be.
What did it want?
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
I've been dreaming about this.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Buddy, you're just a child.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Neither do I.
I do, too!
What do you think, Brother?
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Heh, what a hypocrite.
Excuse me, gotta go to bathroom.
Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider.
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
He had his hand on her titty.
She's putting the titty back.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
No, Mother, he's lying...
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
What's goin' on?
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
Of course.
I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Well, she's back.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
-- I am not responsible for her epizootics and I did not bring about her epizootics. Now listen to me. When I have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
Is anything wrong?
You don't know where you're going?
Strange voices, Rose?
Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing.  Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger?
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state!
Yes, I am.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
Yes, go on.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Well, you run on now.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose.  But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Never again, never again...
I... I can explain...
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
Nothing, I guess.  Just an observation.  She's really something special.  You're a lucky fella.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
"A.D."
Where you gonna be?
No offices are gonna be open today.
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
What's the plan?
Dean Martin.
Where we going?
Gimmie a butt.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
What's mine say?
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Where we going?
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
Can't I?
He went to pick up lunch.
And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Your poison's not gonna make it into the veins of any kids this time.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
Yeah... great.
You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
Can't be worse than you.
What... ?  Not you too?
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
This much powder you don't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. It's got to be smuggled.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
I don't think so.
You always did have style.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Jabba's palace.
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many things.
Han!
Are you all right?
The same as always.
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready, everybody?
I don't know.  Fly casual.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
Lando, grab it!
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
Here we go again.
What are you telling them?
What did he say?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
All wings report in.
Good shot, Red Two.
There it is!
What's he saying?
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
You promise you won't tell?
He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
Janet.
Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
Oh....Say something.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Well I want to leave.
This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
Right!
Maybe we could try it this way.
I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
"Sweet Transvestite"
"Transylvania"
On the day I went away.
Was all I had to say
Wheeling
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
I think you had better both come inside.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
It's Thanksgiving.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Some people are very shy by nature.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
Would ya like a glass of water?
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
They're all the same.
...What?
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Like?
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Oh, Rocky!
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
...Paulie. Stop now!
Don't do that again!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
Hear she's retarded.
Kiss my ass.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
This a con?
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
I say ya nothin'!
...The juice is climbin' every week.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
What?
Makes your breath like garbage.
Goodnight, Rocky.
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
How old?
...Who'd ya fight?
Rice is a bum.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
How 'bout a glass of water?
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Please, kid.
Whatta you get outta this?
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
How I look out there, Mick?
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Yo, Paulie.
Hey --
Don't get mental, man.
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
It don't bother me none.
Help what?
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
I'll tear his head off.
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
No.  But neither does Roger.  That's Diablo Red.  Roger's pants are Sunrise Orange.
Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
So you decided to help him after all?
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
What was <u>that</u>?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
Holy shit, he's a Toon!
Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
You shot Roger.
I didn't know who I could trust.
Hold on a second.
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
I got him on loan from Disney.
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Valiant!  You surprised me.
You tricked me, damn you!
Pattycake!  Pattycake!
So I hear.  Even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
I'll get it.
Wrong number?
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
Keep reading...
No, kid, you're a real hero.
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
Good heart, at what?
Farewell, my cuz.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
What, daughter are you busy? Need you my help?
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
This is important.
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
Look, Sam, don't take it the wrong way when I tell you we won't be doing this again.
I better be getting that.
I'm a patriate.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
It's quite satifactory.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
That fucking figures...
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
He's company.
Here's yours.
If you say a word in English, Vincent, my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat. Sorry to screw you over like this, but the information you want might get me killed if I give it to you, and that's a price I'm not willing to pay.
Where's my information?
We'll die if we stay here!
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!
Is it done?
Gregor, is that you?
I would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the American.
I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
And you respect him.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.
Yeah.
Created?
Vincent's life is his own burden; he'll have to carry it for himself.  And I'm not any kind of Samurai.
Long enough to shoot back.
Yeah, well...  My way works too.
It's a cocktail.  Mostly demerol, cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Where is this broad?
Where to?
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
Lovely, isn't it?
What's going on?
I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?
What the fuck happened?
Give me a cigarette.
I'm not here very much.
No you don't, and you know it.
Not here.  They might see it.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
You have to stop doing that!
What happened to it?
Gaelic.
Last I heard there was a film rep for the Irish players staying at this address, name of Seamus Reilly.
You slept with her!
You put everything on the line because you...
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Sort of!
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
What the hell...
Ten thousand right here.
We don't know that.
We'll torch the bases, how's that?
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
That's not what I mean.
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
He's going to be trouble.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
We've got to go now, then.
Oh Jesus...
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Well, I don't know...
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
Whoa, Earl!
How are ya?
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
Hi.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
So do I.
I don't know, Booth.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  Came through a store called After Midnight.  There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
Anything I can help you with?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Sixty five...  Jeez Louise!
I don't suppose you've seen her.
Shopping here?
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
Something wrong, Jesse?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out.  And do it all over again tomorrow!
You'd do this to me?!
We're out of here.
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
Oh Jesus Christ...
I don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
Hi ma.
Did they ever find out who they were?
Are you hungry?
Not in the trunk.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
Yeah.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
The band has been playing over an hour.
What?
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
They use an optical transfer ink from India that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
You bring American money?
You get massage from Chinese girl before?
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
What'd I say?
You lied to me.
I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner.
Hello.
What's wrong?
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
I have plenty of dates.
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
No, no, that would be crazy --
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
It sounds impossible --
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Who?
You sound like that all the time.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
Is it hot in here?
Let me see it again?
Are you okay?
Well we're not friends.
I think we should stop talking.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
Very nice.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
No you didn't!
We made it, man.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
First class.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
Put your arms around me.
Do you still have the bills?
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Who the hell is that?
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Shut up!
I don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
He was just doing his job.
Right....
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
You want more?
That's not how it goes.
Which one?
Oh no.
You're killin' me here.
Last night's as much my fault as yours.  If he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
In Charge.  Just me'n him.  No interference.  They don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  I love the F.B.I.  I love the F.B.I.
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Any demands yet?
Hmmmm?
Okay, let me start from the top.  A few days ago I was on this munitions dealer named Lafontaine. Now, after the shit blew up last night...
You sonuvabitch.
Hello.
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
I'm not running.
Only respectful things.  What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
We do it to our dog.
Rub your ears.
I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Fisher, let him talk.
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
Maggie!
Look, he's running after her.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
They made me put my hat back on.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
Five hundred.
I'm a work in progress.
You look... uh... You look fine.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
Brian told you that?
That's called changing your mind.
Yes, you!
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Does it matter?
I'm listening.
You're a goddess!
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
He's going to be the pastor?
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
You tell Maggie.
No, no.  You're her best friend.
I hate boats.
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Don't touch them.  I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this.  This is a big moment for me --
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Happy New Year, darling.
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
You okay?
Oh!
It's not true, but it feels true.
What?
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
What?
I love that dream.
But he saw you, right?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
What about the letter?
You're going to miss the train.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
It's probably just the flowers --
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Are his folks nice?
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Hi.
Which means --
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Who is this?
It's been about a year and a half.
Why not?
You don't like the one he was now?
And you're worried about him.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
You'll see.
Dad, could you close the door?
It's Y. O. H.
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
Does red pepper go under R or P?
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
Somewhere in the middle.
Dad, this is amazing.  If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Great.
Why is she bringing that bag?
Jonah!
Have you seen my wallet?
What if I couldn't get to you?
Hi, Sam.  And let me guess -- you must be Jonah.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Hi.
Yes?
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
Hi.
I thought you were never going to call me.
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
You're welcome to one.
The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
Mornin'.
Jenkins ain't no boss.  Mean we're gonna let people like Jenkins stay here?
Who? A scab?
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
This water's cold again.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
NO, she wants to be there.  And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes.  The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
When?
Ramn were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
You know I don't think that.
Lus! Come down here!
Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out ...
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Ramn -- listen my kids ...
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
They were wearing ski masks. I told you all of this.
Ride 'em cowboy)
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
Yeah.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Oh God.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
Is that how you play?
What do you want from me, Colette?
Who is it?
I need my paycheck.
How you holding up?
What time is it?
Nice day
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
Fuuuuuck
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
Danny?
What's this?
What the hell is that?
What?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
You're serious?
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.
I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
You want to do this some other time?
I'm sorry?
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
What the hell is this?
No last name?
Yeah. Pretty sure.  Oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
Danny, I'm touched.
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
You've got no choice.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
That's because he doesn't have one.
What? Is it bad?
Murder.  Beautiful.
Please ... don't do this ...
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
We know what's going on.
Jimmy?
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
What's that smell?
What'd you do, piss your pants?
Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?
Tom, quit fucking around.
No. You know what gets old? Being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
My sentiments exactly.
Golly, I hadn't thought of that.
Find a chaplain.
Resistance?
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
Yep.
Jackson?
Reiben, how many time I got to tell you, I'm from Tennessee.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
Y'all come back.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Captain, my feet are most uncomfortable.  If I'd 'a known we was gonna have to walk all the way to Ramelle, I never would 'a volunteered for this here mission.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Reiben, I want you to listen closely to Jackson.  This is the way to gripe. Jackson, continue.
We left them eighty-eights.
Watching.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
But you could have gotten killed and I...
I wonder where they're going.
There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
GO!
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
You?  Leading a squad?
What about the company?
Beasley's dead.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
There's a war on, good chance they're not still making lingerie in Caen.
Captain, could you please explain the math of this mission to me?
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.
Scans the Germans with his binoculars.
What deal?
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee, he was going to be a preacher, his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch Hudson.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
How do you do it?
What's the profile?
No, no he's not.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Keep it.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
I'll be in my office.
Look at those eyes.
Please?
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
I wouldn't get my hopes up Lloyd.
I told him to be himself.
Lloyd, it's us.
Wait a minute.
I can put that together.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
What are you doing?
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
I won?
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
You should be.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Did he ever get rough with you?
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
No, you don't know what it is.  It's not for me.  This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again.  Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do.  I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Hello.
This is me telling you about me.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
Are you busy on Saturday?
So you're monumentally busy?
Well...
Whoa.
What are these?
So we can finally talk?
It's just you and your dad, right?
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
I think you should wear that.
Won't you see me later?
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
It's okay, everybody does that.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
Are you comfortable?
I don't think so.
I don't think I am.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
How do you know what I'm going to say?
Is this because of your dad?
Then don't do it.
What do you want?
I'm fine.
Okay, I'll give here the message.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
We finally graduated, big dude guy!
We're full on bonded.
Later for you, Luke.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
Luck.
Should I stay?
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
When?
Where are the guards?
What's that?
So I'm responsible for the weather?
What do I got for you?
The SS beat me up.  They would have killed me, but I'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
Good.  How's it going?
What are you doing?
That'd be fine.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Pots and pans.
That's very generous of you.
Well, that's to be expected.  They have to understand.  These are start-up problems. This isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  I'll write them a letter.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
I can do it, Captain.
I would say we are now officially baffled.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
No, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
I couldnt believe you didnt recognize me. You even interviewed me for your book.
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
About what?
Lemme take you home.
What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
A twist ending if you will.
We had to have financing.
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
You have every right to be upset.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Jesus Christ!
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
No, wait...
Sidney. Hello. How are you?
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
He tried to kill her first.
Knock yourself out.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
What about rehearsal?
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
The young girl is slashed again.
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
I gotta hit the library. Anatomy. Some of us have real majors. You gonna be okay, Sid?
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
..this week's TKE kegger...
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Asshole, Can't talk.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?
What kind of a game?
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Are you sure?
I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
Did you request this case?
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
How is that good news?
Oh yeah, how?
Detective Kincaid?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Where's Gale?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
Gale, your engine's still running.
Do you have her number stored in your memory?  Phone memory!
Has anyone else every used your phone?
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
So you knew Sidney Prescott's mother.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Your life?
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Shit! Where the hell are Tom and Angelina?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
No really?
Basements creep me out.
Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
Oh, Come on!  You have made millions off the story of her murder.  You're obsessed with HER and you're obsessed with her DAUGHTER!
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
I know!
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
It's Sarah.
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
Hello?
No I need to call you. Just you.
Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
Think about it. On the off chance I get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. You took my mother, so I took yours. Big sympathy factor. Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. It certainly fucked you up. It made you have sex with a psychopath.
It's on the table.
FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!
Did you ride past Casey Becker's house?
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
Jesus, SHIT!
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
I wanna let go. I do...
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Yes.
Hello.
What?
Hello.
I don't think so.
Uh-huh.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Uh-huh.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
That's not what you said.
Nah, I don't think so...
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
So you better leave.
How do you know his name?
Where are you?
Please don't hurt him.
What kind of game?
Please don't do this...
No...
But you're doing so well.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.
You tricked me...
And why is that? Has something happened?
Really? You small town guys are good. And have you located Sidney's father?
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
What brings you out to these parts?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
I don't know. I guess.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
You girls ready.
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Casey! Casey!
What? What?
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture.
How's the book?
Please. You owe me.
You owe my mother.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered.
Don't start. You know I don't watch that shit.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Hello?
Stu was with me last night.
Fuck you, nut case. Where were you last night?
THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT -- How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies?
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
Which is you...
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.
Why are they doing this?
Or a man's mentality.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Thanks, Tatum.
Do you really think Billy did it?
Come on, Sid.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.
Shit, what is he doing here?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
Who?
You don't.  It goes to court now.
What do you think?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
It's none of my business anymore.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
What the hell's going on?
I don't believe it.
What's so exciting?
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
A woman...
Tell me what it was that gave me away. What was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before I walked up to YOU and put my hands in the air.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
You've made a good life for yourself...
You think it was poison?
Is that clear?
This doesn't make any sense.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
I'm declining this case.  I want us reassigned.
I'd like you to meet Somerset.
You go to movies at least?
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Does this make it with you?
You tell me.  I'm new in town.
The fingerprints.
Why would we?
The way this has gone till now, I wouldn't have thought it was possible, but we may have underestimated this guy.
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
I'm sick of sitting around, waiting for him to kill again.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
How much money do you have?
Well, that was money well spent.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
The hell I can't!  We get in there and we can stop him.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
Where's the victory?
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Oh, you want to stay now?
Well... what the fuck, man?
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Perfect example.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
How's California?
Now, Ethan, I ain't sure...
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
Let's get along...
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
Another one, eh?
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
I didn't give any order to fire!
Evenin'...evenin' Reverend...or do I call you 'Captain'...?
Now son, it's a bitter thing to say, but there's more than your sister at stake here.
I say NO!
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Colonel Greenhill's compliments, sir. The Colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of Rangers in the field, fully armed and...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Told ya, didn't I?
Scar! Where's he holed in?
That's what I said.
Keep talking.
Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
Easy on that!
You want us to fire a shot if...
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
Hey! What's the idea...?
Futterman?
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Lemme alone...
You figger Scar means to kill us?
Why didn't he make his move back there?
They'll be back...
Well, we only got the one lead -- Scar...And where we begin to look, I don't know...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
They never find that girl.
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
Fetch <U>what</U> home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
She'd be about thirteen now...
Ellen, move aside...
Stop that!
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Maybe the antenna's broken.
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?
I miss Tommi so much.
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
Who's that?
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
Of course you'll give me the blame again.  Like back then.  Just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, Ellen?
That's alright.  Don't misunderstand my husband.  It's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. And who would believe him if he told the truth?
Hello.  Can I help you?
Do I look like it that much?
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
And that is?
It all went so fast.  He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  I only wanted to defend myself.  You have to call the police...
Oh, Mrs. Straub.  May I introduce you to my wife?
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
Hey, my man!  How's the masterpiece coming along?
Ah
Follow that boat!
Thank you, my lady!
Never!
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
What is the chief part?
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
A woman of property?
Will it restore my gift?
I have a wonderful new play!
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
What's the title?
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
There's never any
by order of the Master of the Revels!
So what do we do?
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Who is she this time?!
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Where are you going?
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
We are lost.
I have a new one nearly done, and better. The Massacre at Paris.
His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
"Good morrow, cousin."
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
Not ready? Where is she?
God bless you!
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
And--?
Your Majesty!
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
"The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night. See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Oh my lady, my love!
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
Nono.
An excellent beginning  Let him bea duke. And your heroine?
But all ends well.
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
What of her bosom?
Is there a man?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
What's his name?
All right, just a few questions.
Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
You think so?
He's still here.
Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
So who's going to do it?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
Good luck. I love that guy, but why does he have to follow us around?
Yeah, but you were good, you were really good. Fucking bin-bag', I liked that. You were good. You explored your maleness to the full there.
How much did you pay?
How much?
Nothing.
No, really, I am sorry, sorry to be ducking out on you like this. I hope you won't take it personally.
What?
Well?
Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
Parked outside?
Sorry to waste your time.
Right.
That's right.
Cameron.
Yes.
For my life? At a discussion group? I think not.
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
Well, she had problems --
Who was it?
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
David hasn't seen him either.
Maybe he didn't like us.
What sort of car?
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Now?
Don't.
Unfeasible.
I don't want to. It's different.
Sshh.
Love and happiness for ever.
Cameron. You remember Cameron.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
You know we're right.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Everything. Except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place. OK? That's important to me. I need to die misunderstood.
Interesting.
So, uh...
Can you afford this place?
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
Is this where no one stays?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
Are you all right?
Do you know many of these people?
We already know. All about it.
But they sneer, don't they?
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know, but, yes, we're methodical, yes, we're dilligent, yes, we're serious, and where's the crime in that, and why not shout it from the rooftops, yes, maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring, but by God, we get the job done.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
What guy?
You must be Hugo.
No.
Do you think you could answer that?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
It was some guy called Brian.
No. I haven't seen them.
Diseases.
I suppose so.
Don't you think there's too much gold?
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
I don't know.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
-- Anyway.
I know.
But aren't you...
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
Oh, no.
Like what?
Well, is she your girlfriend?
Then it's not your problem.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
I asked you first.
Yeah, it is.
You are.
Wonderful woman.
You do know what money's like these days.
Pardon me?
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
-- Well no. It never came up.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
You know what I'm talking about.
Baby...
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
-- gee...
I don't know what gets into me.
That sounds like me.
Where do you want to go?
He still having parties?
-- where'd you go?
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
I've got to leave?
Look about last night --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
Well then what are you trying to do-
God, there's Lester...
Oh yeah?
Yeah!
What with?
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
Not yet.
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.
There were some shots.
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
George --
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
You've never even been around one.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
Yeah, baby...
Yeah.
Go where?
Whether or not I'm going.
Right now?
Jill says nothing.
A friend dropped me off.
What business meeting?
I've got to get her out of here.
-- well aren't you --
Bullshit.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
What do you wanna know for?
Baby, don't do this --
-- yes.
George...
Said what!
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
Sorry, honey, I...
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
Godammit, George...
I wanna hear about it.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
I wanna hear it from you!
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
She's nothing but a whore.
Come on by.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
Shut the door, shut the door!
I'd like a drink.
No.
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
That's right.
-- Yeah, honey...
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
It's been so long I don't how long?
-- He reached up and tore them.
Oh. thank you.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Good for you.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
George? Was he alone?
-- why?
What's wrong?
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
-- there's not much room --
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
Do you have something against traveling?
Everything okay, son?
Call me Les.
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
How's it going, Doc?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
Room 237?
Sure, Danny, it will be lots of fun.
Mom?
I won't make any noise.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Danny?
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy...
Is Tony one of your animals?
Because he hides.
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
That doesn't matter, sir.  You're the important one.
Who?
How?
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Oh Dick, come on over and say hello to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
Bill, how do you do?
Eh - formerly a school-teacher.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
Hi, babe.
Eleven thirty - Jesus!
No.  It's the truth, really.  I swear it.  Danny told me.  He went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  She tried to strangle him.
He's still asleep.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Jack!
I don't know.
Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
Yes...
Of course I am.
Have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
Stay away from me!
I just want to go back to my room.
Have any trouble finding us?
Only in a very general way.
I don't believe they did.
I'd better collect my family first.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
We can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
By five o'clock tonight, you'll never know anybody was ever here.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-Jesus-CHRIST!
Lowe's car-?
Can I tell you kids something?
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
What's the money for?
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Went shopping. Why?
Jane... you don't have to do that.
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager! Stone the crows!
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that... but I got something that just might cheer you up.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
What is it?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
I saw what I saw.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
But how?
You know, I just might!
LET THY SPIRIT
He's... dreamy.  He's...
How come?  Sister?
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!
Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
Sure.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
That machine.
Like this place?
Shirelles.
What?
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
Babies
What?
Three years.  A rookie.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
Bobs
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  We're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
Mary Clarence!
The reason?
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
Sometimes it's not enough!
So... hi there.
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
You're my Olympic event.
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
A vote?
Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
What are you doing here?
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo- lang.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
Ten flights?
I hate you.  I totally hate you.
And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
I just need a few more weeks,
What'd she say?
So what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
I am?
Really?  Lieutenant?
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
You're not... seeing anybody?
I can't go with you.
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
We could put you into our witness protection program.
It's done?
I can't see anything in here!
Joey?
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're an example to us all.  You've taught us so much.  We're singing for the Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
An... entertainer?
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Who took the meat?
Hail, Constable.  How are you?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
What the hell are you doing?
You must have missed your mark.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
No bleeding.
Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you?
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
Do you have these persons' wills?
Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered.
Very few, if any.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
Listen to what you say....
The Lenape Indian had much to tell once I opened his mouth.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
What is it?
All I saw was their lantern.
No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has gone intestate.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
What now?
How are you?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
Thank you.  No.  Here...
You promised justice.
What are you on about?
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
Allow me some time.  I have spent every hour in the company of others. I need to be alone.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room.
What... what are you doing?
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Go home.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
All right then.
Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for them rackets and breathin' things he does. Ain't threatened me with a killin' or anything.  But boy you couldn't of been more right about him fixin' things. That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves french fries. Eats four larges and don't even so much as belch. I'm proud to have him.
I'll see you, Bill.
Did you decide, sir?
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
Okay ladies and gentlemen  or both. It's come to the time in our show when we like to introduce the band. Over here on lead guitar Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on hit a hot lick, Randy.  Well, come on, y'all are supposed to clap now. Come on! 
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Leave.
How'd your baptizin' go?
Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you, was I?  Was I?
I want to watch T.V.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
Don't hit that boy no more.
He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
What are all them books?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
They still around, your folks?
How do you know?
How did your mama die?
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Maybe they needed it.
Where'd you get them flowers?
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
Oh, jackin' off?
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
Why?
So it died when it come out?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
What you readin'?
It was fun, anyhow.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
That grass out in the yard's all growed up. I figured I might cut it fer ye.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Yeah.
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
You scared me.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Do you reckon you can make me some biscuits?
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
What brings you back?
Why are you here now?
Do you have family here?
I done et just a little bit ago.
I reckon I can stand to eat a little somethin' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters. But I reckon he can lay off doin' it tomorrow.
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
Okay.
Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Are you sure it's safe to let him around that guy?
Karl, maybe you and Melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner. It's a nice night.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
It's coming along. At the rate he's going, he'll have a story finished by the end of the summer.
No! At least I don't think I am!
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
And what are you, his chaperone?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
And your father? Is he from New York?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
And what about for you?
What about for you?
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
A photographer ...
Slow down, huh?
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
No, he's not. You are.
So what did he say when he called?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Hey, man, how's it going?
You usually get two.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
She probably died.
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
Like what?
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
Still, you can't just write her off.
She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
What's this?
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
There's just one thing I want to know.
Okay. I think everything's set.  You've got the number for Cape Cod, right? Just in case something goes wrong.
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
Does it hurt?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
I figured he had a right to know.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Five bucks! You mean you're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it?
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
Thomas Cole. My name is Thomas Jefferson Cole.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
That's it. Just the two rooms.
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Time to wake up.  Hey, kid, time to wake up.  Rashid!  Up and out. I have to work in here. The slumber party is over.
Three nights.
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Appreciation for what?
Where the hell do you think you're going?
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
And?
Let's not get too idealistic.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
And started to run.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
No wonder he was angry.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
None.
Why?  If they could never take title.
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.
Just three questions.  The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Doesn't it seem to <u>you</u>, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
You don't believe in God anymore.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't telling her.  Telling someone. What I'd found.
Your father fought at Belleau Wood, it took him years to get over it.  Nightmares, tears, b...
And your evaluation of the defendant?  Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a <u>single</u> overturned <u>cup</u> in its wake?
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
Well, the freighter.  The twine. The blood.  The knife.  The cup. The watch.  The second battery. The phantom lantern.  The fishing gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's <u>eleven</u> things...
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
It's on the twine, too.  But it's not r...
That's when he fell.
Coincidences happen.  You run a yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy happens every day.  Or maybe...
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
You must think I like losing.
You want me to say that.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
No spare.
You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
What else could it be?
That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
Well...
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
...He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Wanna see my driver's license?
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
Cut it out, girls.  Stop it. Joe - Josephine - help!
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
You're right, Joe.
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
Yeah - where were you?
You've flipped your wig!
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
I think they got me.
You going to call the police?
We got to get out of town.  Maybe we ought to grow beards.
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
DAPHNE?
Hello, everybody.  I'm the bass fiddle. Just call me Daphne.
Done what?
What happened?
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
I'll say there is!
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Jerry, listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it's just not being done!
Hey - these are real diamonds.
Joe -
Not that, you idiot.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
Oh - Sugar!
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
I'm not crowding you, am I?
And your head is hot.
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
Uh-uh.  Not yet.
Not you, Sugar.
I'll carry the instruments.
Here you are, Sugar.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Oh, please do come.  Don't disappoint us. It'll be such fun.  And bring your yacht.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
Yeah - Josephine.
We don't have to run.
Josephine -
No!
What for?
I was it.
We could pass for that.
We could dye our hair.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
Mama is keeping score.  Frankly, she's getting rather annoyed with me
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
You must be quite a girl.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Another bridesmaid?
We can have it altered.
Why not?
I forgive you.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Anything today?
What's the job?
Because I got some plans -
Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
What are you - a couple of comedians? Get out of here!  Long distance?  Get me the William Morris Agency in New York.
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
Put it here.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
Yeah.
Brains aren't everything.
You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
I want mine to wear glasses.
What's happened?
Thank you.
How's the stock market?
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Yeah.  Real hot.
- and always the same Four Hundred.
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
You collect shells?
Would you mind moving along, please?
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Oh - in here.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
It's not the icebergs.  But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
What else is there for me? 
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Would you do me a favor?
Anything this time?
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Daphne -
You'll forget him, Sugar.
PLEASE!
What'll it be, sir?
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
We got different information.
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
What's his first name?  And where does he live?
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
That's very refreshing. Now what's the password?
Look, Chief - I better blow now, because if Spats Colombo sees me, it's Goodbye Charlie.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Too bad, Charlie.  You would have had three eights.  Goodbye, Charlie!
I should get going.
Does Kat know?
Whats going on with you two?
I think I love you, mate.  How do you know so much about so much?
Ill just check into a hotel.
Whats his problem?
And Kat was fully clothed.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Hey, you!
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, were the past. Im not sure if you noticed, but Im here with someone else.
Kat, wait. I dont want you hating me. Weve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Mmm.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
You quitting?
Who are they?
Yes.
Come on.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. Its all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youre not walking away!
Fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
I should go.
Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You havent visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Like fifteen.
Not yet...
Im guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
What is it you do again?
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
And you say all them people is dead now?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
What about Sounder?
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
Well, how did you like the class, David?
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
And so you did your job, right?
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.
But, Charlie --
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
David Lee...
When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Mama is outside with Josie Mae and Earl.
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
Goodnight, Daddy...
Daddy, you home now... that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else...
You feel alright today, Daddy?
Daddy, when is we goin' huntin'?
From Miss Johnson --
But, Daddy, you need me here to help you in the field -- Daddy, your leg is hurt -- you can't work like you used to. Who's gonna help you!? Who's gonna do the work, Daddy?!
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?
When's that?
Where did it come from, Mama?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Poor creature...
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
What's wrong with him, David?
This is for your mama's work, and here's something for the three of you.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
The most important thing is that you're home!  We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE CLITORIS!!
To free Terrance and Phillip.
Fuck that!  AGAGH!!
Cartman, over zere, is the electrical box. You must sneak over zere and shut it off before I return with Terrance and Phillip or the alarms will sound and I will be shot full of holes. Got it?
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny every day.
Cartman?!
GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN FAULT!
Mrphmmmph!!!
Look, Eric it's your little friends.
Goodnight, honey.
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
Chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
May I?
Purpre mama!
Donkey raping shit eater.
Ber dada!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
Mrph?
Kyle, you take your little brother out to play with you!
Terrance and Phillip, you are under arrest for working in America without the proper documents! WE GOT YOU!
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
That's gonna take a long time!
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
It's so very cold...
It's okay, I am done for.
That was sweet!
Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
How can they do this?
That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
This is sweet!!
I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
Stan!
Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.
Oh dear God...
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
I am the dark master!
But I-
You'd fuck your uncle!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Hey, I'm missing the party!
I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
Got it.
Getting drunk is no solution.
I think we're moving.
Anna...
Evening.
Excuse me?
Oh, thank you.
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Weren't you down in the dining room?
Were you going to give it to them?
On channel 10?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
So, are you on for the next one?
You gotta think of your old age.
Much as I'd like to help you and our valued guests, I'm afraid I can't.
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?
I don't know what you're talking about!
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Idiot...
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Look at this...Jesus.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
What's the use...we're gonna die...
We're going to die.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
What are we going to do?
We don't.
OK...it's open.
Damn it.  If only we could get to those suits... Dawn then thinks of something -
He certainly is polite.
It must be oxygenated if we can hear him.
I don't know what we're facing.
Well, Dawn, I'm an optimist by nature.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
I guess I owe you a debt of gratitude.  You saved my life.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
So what's going to happen to you?
Sooner than later.
What the hell are you doing?
So close...
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
Yeah, but it didn't go so good. He wasn't the man I thought he'd be. Theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup, but his hands are trembling, spilling some of the coffee.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
After we ID, we bury the body. Case and casket closed.
Hey, ain't I seen you on the tour?
Your pop said to put these on his tab. Sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door.
You know, Elvis bowled.
This scam we got going here was your 
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
Orange whip, nectar of the bowling gods. Thanks sweetie. Millie turns the tray so that Buzz takes the untainted whip.  Theo takes the other glass.
Where'd you get this ball?
Grace Skinner. Who's Grace Skinner to you?
You're a bullshit artist, that's what you are. You got no right to be here! Theo yanks the trophy away from Buzz.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
No...
The whole world thinks you're underground.
Son?
Hello?
I don't like to talk about it.
Who's there!
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
That's some pinfall. Almost a 133 average. Her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.
Then I'll have the number four with one of your finest whips.
This is a vicious cycle.
Kinda tough on the butt.
What does he do?
Mind if I cut in?
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Do you have a boyfriend?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
How much would you charge me for the lips?
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
And besides, it's probably too late, anyhow.
Nothing.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
You told Junior that we did it.
My word is good, and it'll always be good. When did I ever give my word to you?
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Fletcher!  Now!
Hold on --
Where is it?
Norman, please!  Don't!
Thank you, Colonel.
What have you been told so far?
Anything else?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Off the record, I don't mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
They pressurize us with helium.
Like "Thou shall not kill"?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
Wait a second --
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
I see it.
What caused it?
I'm getting no sub reading, sir.
Yes, sir.
Norman, get out of there now! Norman?
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
So?  What's the problem?
Are you enjoying yourself, Harry, because I don't know what the hell you're doing.
Not now, Beth.  Please.  I want to know who we're talking to before we start talking.  Where's Edmunds?
With an "o".  Harold with an "o".
Look at this.
Some sort of lead or something.
What's wrong?
They switched us over.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Edmunds?
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
Yeah, it was awful.
What do you mean -- not normal?
Wait a minute.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
But I don't know how --
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
What's the matter?
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
That wasn't in there before.
None of this was here before.
You don't believe me.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Page 87.
After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him.
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Looks like some sort of code.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Three to six hours.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
How do you feel about snakes?
You know what I mean.
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Do you fear them?
You manifested that, Beth.
You're insane.
Yes.
I promise --
Beth --
Beth!
Beth, stop it!
Beth?
You hear that?
Just in time, too.
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
Where's it coming from?
Our answer.
And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it.
I can't believe that, Harry.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
What is that?  That noise?
You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
You don't remember that?
Beth left?
Wisconsin's your answer.
That's right.
Missed.
Well, press something!
What'd you say to him?
Why would this ship carry instructions in English?
We take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it's gonna be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  But there isn't a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even a scratch.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
Well, if it's a discharge --
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
What'd you say?
Good idea, Ted.
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
What report?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
You want me to try?
Try this one.
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
What was it?
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
What kind of a crash was it?
Was it a military crash?
The Empire must have gotten here first.
Well, now you know... The enemy is on the move.  We haven't much time.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
No, not anymore.
How much do you think she's talking about?
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
That's straight through the central core... up toward the top of the city... Once you've got her, avoid the main transports, they'll shut down immediately.  Your only chance is through the service shafts. There are no sensors there... All right now, get going, you don't have time.  I hope you can remember everything.
Good morning!
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
Who are you anyway?
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
You saw through me?
I already know you think you're worthless.  I recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light, for what you believe you are is what you become.  I haven't been involved in anything like this for many years.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
Are you all right?
What do I do?
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
You're Starkiller?
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
There are only three or four left.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
Is he afraid of the water?
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
You're a good pilot... I've learned a lot from you... I wish you...
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
A Wookiee broke loose up here, but we've subdued him... There is a lot of damage, and three, no four, casualties...
The 'Death Star' has become operational.  There is no force in the universe that can stop us now.
Are there medical facilities on Yavin?
You'll check the condensing unit first... and you're not going to bed until those 'droids' are completely cleaned up...
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
See Threepio... do you copy?
Wait a minute, slow down!... That's better.  They're where?  They what? They are?  Oh, no! We're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over...
You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you and me could be buddies.
What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
No, this hurts.
Mobile Infantery rules !
We got reinforced. Most of'em just got outa boot...
Saddle up, Roughnecks !
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Please continue, Sergeant.
You don't approve. Well, too bad. We're in this for the species, boys and girls. It's simple numbers, they have more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Or...?
Well, whad'ya know...
WHERE IS IT ?
So ?
I'm sorry, Carmen.
Zander, what are you doing ?
Good for you.
Eeuch !
You can't walk me home.
Isn't it great to be in love ?
No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
Hey, Carl, what's wrong ?
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
Shhhh...!
You don't look very happy to see me.
What ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Hey, amigo, come chow with me.
What ?
You used to dance...
Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?
Johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don't know what I would do...
No, Mr. Rasczak doesn't do that at all. He sorta discourages you really.
A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad'ya think of that ?
I'm telling you, you will ! You're not going back. You're going to go on vacation !
At 0821 we received a distress call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
The Marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
What do you think you're doing ?
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
AAAAAAAAAAAA !
Hit your jets, sir !
Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units?
'To learn all that is learnable.'
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
<U>Computer off</U>!
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us; they could have done that outside.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Forward motion, Captain...!
Was he difficult?
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
That vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the Earth's sun.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
Have you been able to analyze <U>any</U> of this...?
Child...!?
The orbiting devices would be controlled from the point, then...?
Not for us?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
Negative helm control, Captain! Going reverse on impulse power...!
Then you'll be wet.
Go you Huskies?
I want to rent this one.
Well, it had sentimental value.
You haven't heard of it.
So young, so unlined, so full of promise.  So innocent.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
I...
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
So that the Old Mill, the Old <u>Mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
...such a pleasant sound.
...who...?
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure if I'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  That's the truth.  The truth's best, don't you think?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
What I need to <u>say</u>...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Uh huh.
Fix my glasses.
Thank you.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
...he stuck a fishhook in it. 
...yes.
Where you going?
What would you do with it, the printshop...
That's something a man could do...?
What is it all about?
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
And I might have something important to tell you...
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
He works on the movie.
Mornin', Doc...
Town ain't got no courthouse.
Well, where do they hold court?
They're holding it for ransom.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
Waterford, Vermont.
It's Marty on the Coast -
Bobby, don't say anything.
That makes a <u>lot</u> of sense, Claire, that makes a lot of...list...listen, cause the audience isn't <u>coming</u> to see your breasts.  They are coming to see you <u>act</u>. What are you doing this evening...?
Mornin, sister.
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
Are you all right...?
What else?
Tell it with...
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
What I...
No, I...just...just Joe, just Joe...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
What's his name?
Get him on the phone.
You have no right to...
I know that...
...I can't do it, Wally...
...I...
I know, it's the hardest thing in the world, and it seems everybody wants...
Not now, I'm talking to the press. Claire!
An artist of your caliber...
I know what you are, I am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when I read that script I said there's only one person to play that part.
...yes...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
You show Claire these sketches?
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
Why not?
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
He didn't have to tell...
My wife's going to have a baby.
Mmmm.  You have children?
Who's White...?
He saw the accident...?
I...
I'm very sorry I...
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  You have the new Old Mill pages?
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  He is the, I would say the most responsible human being I have ever...
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
No, what is it?
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
I...
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
How was your flight?
Did you bring Bob's weights?
What's in all the bags?
It's just a formality.
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
I don't got the money.
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
We got the permit.
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
I've got two days to get this house...
I want them thrown in jail.
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
"Assembly of Death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
Where are we?
Annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
Ben!  What's wrong?
Mass hysteria.
Scream.
How would you know sh...
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
He wouldn't know.  <u>I</u> saw her in the shower!
You don't like his friends.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
I don't want to say goodbye.
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
No.  I told you.  I like apple butter not butter butter.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
And Mom says anger never, never <u>solves</u> anything.  It makes every- thing <u>worse</u>.
Help me here...
Uh.  What is it?
In high school.
The guy <u>I</u> see is in the eighth grade at <u>Prep</u> School, and he laughs his <u>ass</u> off every time we talk about you.
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
But you told us to starve.
Excuse me --
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
That I do.  Always will.
I'm fine, ba...
Mommy's sick, guys.
So you're okay.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
So we'll...radiate some more?
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
Congratulations.  Only forty minutes late.  You're handling this promotion really well Rachel.
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
Which part of no don't you understand?
Because you don't really seem here.
I've been with someone for quite some time, and didn't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  But after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids I might add -- she moved in last month.
Rachel's not half my age.
Me too.
Our children.
I didn't think a phone call was appropriate...
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them...I'd like you to be there.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Get out!
Yeh?
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
You feeling all right?
Uh.  Have you told Luke and the ki...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
Okay, I'm undeserving.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
She's devastated.
So.  Hopeful.
I really look like shit.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y...
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Yah?  Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  Needs to know when to find a Plan B.  Cos Plan A <u>is</u> not and <u>will</u> n...
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna.  I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
My advice to you?  Don't die.
You really didn't have to come, you know.  I'd have brought them straight t...
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Why didn't I?
With good reason.  They fucking worship you as it is.
You ride with Annabelle...
We have the kids this weekend, so...
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Well, I think you should tell him you changed your mi...
It's just an assignment.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
Restless.
No prob. I'm cool.
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Nice to have you here.
Really? How many?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
When I'm in high school I'm not going to play any football. I'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  What did you do in high school?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
Gee, I didn't even know you had any children. But why are you so upset about Jesus?
Oh. How did it happen?
How did they execute him?
But still, you can't be sure.
Why was he on Death Row?
So whaddya think?
The camerawork's nice.
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
We're not ready!
Steak's really good tonight. SCOOBY  Good.
Marty...
Ready for tomorrow?
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Which is it? You gotta keep your focus straight.
So? How was school today?
The same. Same as what?
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Come here, give me a hug!
Hello, Vi.
Oh.  Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
No.
OK.
Hello?
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Anything I might know about?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. Kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. I wrote to Derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. But everything's still kind of in development at this point.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Uh, Scooby, now I understand how you want to be a TV talk-show host and all, like Conan O'Brien, but did you know even he went to college?
Henry, what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
I'll lead.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
Now what?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
What about rule one:  never let the person you are protecting out of your sight!
That's it!  Up ahead!
You see, it paid off--you broke away from the old guard, congresswoman.  It won't be long till they're calling you Senator Filmore--
Is there anything in there that can blow?  We have to be ready for any contingency--
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
How goes the roll call?
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Good.
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Where is this...thing?
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
Damn it!  Damn it!  I've been telling you all for years you've got too damned many psychoes in the service.
Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
You're a good officer, Major Mandrake.  You have a right to know.  It looks like we're in a shooting war!
What's the gun for, General Ripper?
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
Do you think we'd cheat?
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
I believe it will be just a few minutes, at the most.
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
What's the target.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
Yeah, to see if we're on our toes.
What else could it be?
He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
Check.
Missiles!  Sixty miles off, heading in fast.  Steady track, they look like beam riders.
Just the missiles.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Where'd they get you?
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
Listen, King, old buddy.  On behalf---
Shoot, Lothar.
That's what I said.
Check target approach.
Master safety.
Primary bomb is live.
Yes, Major.
He's dead, all right.
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
The CRM-114 is smashed, right?
We crossed the coast over an hour ago. Okay?
Are you sure?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
When they emerge, a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable, if they are moth-balled in advance.  I would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years.
Uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
Can I have some?
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Typical male.
Uh, home, you know.
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Yeah.
Hey, it's me. No, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
Jesus Christ.
No, he's not with a girl.
I'd get bored.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
That sounds so depressing.
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
Hey, you know me.
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
What?
Yeah, man.
Ah, you know people there?
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Pony? What's a "pony"? You mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? What's that guy's name? Neil Moynihan?
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
Yes! Free concert!
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
Look, look, look. You gotta go now, okay? The customers complain.
Pakeesa? It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on, they're just joking around.
It's okay.
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
You okay, man? You okay?
You were a shitty lineman and now your a shitty cop. Yeah, blow me, I'm drunk.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
Yeah. So, what about you?
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
I know. It's okay.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Oh, wow.
It's coming along.
Buff, sit. You know what I mean though? Somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
Oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, Pony, the rockstar. I understand. So you, do you, want us to, leave?
I ate a dog when I was in Thailand. Tasted exactly like this sparerib.
What? What'd you do?
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
You lied to me.
I don't know.
No? Well, I disagree. I think they did. I think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? Makes me sick.
No.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
Please?
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck I am.
Yes, you asshole.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
Oh, yeah?
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
What?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
New ground?
My goal is to make art.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Mm-hm.
Good, man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I crash there.
The prom. That's funny.
Now?
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
Yeah, well, that's what I do too.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
I don't know.
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Get off my property!
Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
Oh!
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Yeah?
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
"Drove down the highway there was a big jam The family had died There inside their minivan There was a backup It went on for miles But as bad as it was It was gone after a while"  Chorus here.  "You may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see To be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
Me?
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
What the fuck are you talking about?!
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Leave him alone, Tim.
Buff is funny, okay? She likes Buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Another sex dream?
Di, are you okay?  We can skip the girl party this week.
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Hello?
Diane?  Diane!
I never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch.  Baby, we are living the great American Dream!
...do not accept charity.  We are two young, able-bodied Americans.  We do not want a handout.  We want a hand-up. Give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow.  Give us corn - the kind you plant, not eat - and we'll grow our own food and... and, uh, then cut it, and - uh, y'know eat it!  Now, if you're interested in giving us a home loan, I will sit back down.  If not, have a nice day, Ma'am.
It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
Yeah, hold on.
Yeah?
... Ja-ck B-ar-t-le-tt... Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?
Is that you down there?
Oh well, then I'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals.
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
They could kill you.
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father.
Give me your coat.
It's from hunger.
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
I didn't.
Now if I got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little?
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ...
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
So do I.
Oh, you --
Good.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Her own movie theatre.
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Yes, I did.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
You are not dressed properly.
I made your bed this afternoon.
Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
You made her a star?
Relax, fans.  The car isn't here.
You don't believe me?  Look in the garage.
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
It is not Mr. deMille in person. It is someone by the name or Gordon Cole.  He says it's very important.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
I came as quickly as I could. What is the danger?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
I think I'd better keep it.
I don't feel like it right now.
At last. Ultimate Power.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
Like it?
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
We can't do that.
You're not afraid are you?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
That makes it worse.
Hi.
You think so?
But what if---it wasn't real?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
No thanks. I have friends in the resistance. They'll vouch for me. I figure I might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
I bet they do.
I know it.
Nurse!
You've been without water for a whole day. Let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
Why the empty cage?
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
I believe there's a rational explanation for everything. But I don't know what it is.
Someone's chasing him.
Oh, Jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
You were? You mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
What are you making:
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
No thanks. You go on.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
What can I do for you?
Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
What's it like?
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
What is this place?
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
...mid pleasures and palaces though I may roam..."
Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Zaltar. Use the wand!
Mr. Roebush?
You're welcome...??
You know what's the problem?
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.
He really was!
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
I'm getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.
Do you really know Superman?
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
Dishwasher? Any luck?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?
It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up. That's how come they shipped the dude to Earth when he was a baby.  well. I know some stuff too, y'all.
Just hold on a minute. I have been doin' some thinkin'
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
Is this whitemail?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Everything.
You want to mess with Superman?
How you doing down there?
What about you?
Why do I have to do this?
Ricky?  Where...what...
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
How would you know?
Come on, will you?  We've got to get ready before he gets here.
Oh, Superman!
I can't! It's out of control!
53.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
I don't kiss.
It could make weather!
Computers talk to other computers, right?
Small potatoes.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
So?
Yes! This time we got it right!
Uh. . .
Actually, yes.
It is kinda romantic.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
It's true. It's true.
You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
I didn't think I wanted to.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Hi.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
What else could I do?
Does Lois know about this yet?
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
You'll miss the battle of the century!
This way Lex.
Artemis? Do you read me?
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
I can't understand it! Where is he? I mean, he shows up every time a cat gets stuck in a tree, and  now he decides to pull a disappearing act?
The three proved - after exhaustive efforts - incapable of rehabilitation. Now as you know, we had no death penalty -
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
Who is this . . . Superman?
Then we must go there too.  To rule. Finally - to rule!  And then you shall have what you want.
He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
General --- ?
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? The cabbie didn't have any change.
Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
Where's Clark?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Hey, Uncle Lex, how's the Nuclear Guy goin' to find his way here?
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Hey! Just remember I made you.
Boy, are you gonna get it.
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
You think he'll find us.
Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
Superman. . .  But you're... dead!
But . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
Ahhhh, my favorite part of the day. Who else could have thought of this aquarium?
You're a great architect, Albert.
It's very simple, Otis.  Very simple, the XK101 rocket. It's nothing, forty years ago we in the Fatherland were working on this. Five more years, we would've had it. But then  --  --  that silly war...Why, my cousin Werner had already  --
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
Keep warm now.
I'd like to.
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Hey!
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Can I take you to the airport?
What'd you call him?
What are you doing here?
So I've noticed.
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Damn!  This will get him.
See?
Don't let me down.
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
I have sworn to uphold the laws of Krypton.
What're you writing, Lois?
Two.
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I guess I got carried away
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
How old are you?
How much do you weigh?
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?
Do you like pink?
Where do you hail from?
There.
I gave him this new face.
Is that real enough for you?
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
Still, foolishly, perhaps, I had a theory that eliminates the Presidential push-button.  I was doing my homework...
Now who's the dreamer, Superman? Even you can't fly that fast!
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
I'm...so sorry.
What happened?
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
Are you sure?
It just seems...kind of weird.
No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Your kids never cry.
You're leaving.
I have to.
From what?
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
What do you mean?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
He knows that?  Billy?
Anything you didn't understand?
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.
What happened to summer?
How was it?
Nicole!
What's vermin again?
Nicole?
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
Dolores.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
When?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Have they ever been busted?
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
DADDY!!!
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
Do you know what that means, Daddy? Does it register?
Some more wine?
I'm a lawyer.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
Yes.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
So you're just the thing we need.
You are?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
You remember this?
You're going to blow everyone away.
Of course.
What's so funny?
What took so long?
The door needs a lock.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
It's because of the accident, Nicole.  Most people in this town whose kids were on the bus have got lawyers.  A lot of people...well, people in this town are very angry. Us included.
Are you sleeping?
What do you mean?
Yes.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
But of course...
Hello, Sidney.  Wanna table?
Did she accept?
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
I see Bartha gave you cold tongue for supper.  Hey, wait a minute!
Mr. Hunsecker, there's nothing to that smear.  You have my sincere word...
Is it news to you?
Mr. Hunsecker, you've got more twists than a barrel of pretzels.
And what have I done to her, besides not buy her a new fur coat lately?  Sidney, you were right -- the boy's a dilly.
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Full of beans, ain't you?  But you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...
Let's forget cats and dogs and other pseudo-literary remarks--- I'll just lay it on the line!  What about that big rumpus in my office today?  You were there, Frank! Where, according to St. Dallas, J.J. was responsible for the Elwell smear!
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
And where was his wife?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Back?
But...
Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
I'm feeling too good to fight with you, but that isn't what I said - I said you snoop.  For instance, what were you doing around my hotel the other night?
Why me...?
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
No, I don't mind.  I'm busy too.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
Don't run away - I was always the man for you!  I'm talking to you out of two years of silence - listen to what I say!  Inside of six months -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
His stooge, Falco, is around - I saw him walk in.  He's been spying on me for weeks, Susie.
I have a message for you; I love you.  May I dedicate the next number to you?...And the next, and the next. Every Sunday I'll buy you a new bonnet -
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
Baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. It's a neural-net process --
Please... let... the kids... go...
Do you know about the chip?
They told us not to ask where they got it.  I thought... Japan... hell, I don't know.  I didn't want to know.
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Radical.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Oww!  Why'd you do that?
How long do you live?  I mean, last?
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Torque wrench please.
This is tactically dangerous.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
No!
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
No shit?
Out of the way, John!
We're better off by ourselves.
Mom?  You okay?
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.
I love you.  I always will.
Kyle, don't go!
You said I could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if I showed improvement in six months.  Well, it's been six months, and I was looking forward to seeing my son.
This T-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Are you afraid?
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
Yesterday I read that Furtwngler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
Where you from, David?
So what is it?
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
You see, Wilhelm, I'm talking about ordinary, everyday reasons. Which is why I want to discuss your private life.  How many illegitimate children do you have?
You bet.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwngler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
I'm sorry.
Major, Major... he's here ...
Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
Or maybe you called Goebbels or Goering? You were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
What did Goering say?
I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
What telegram?
Then you are wrong.
Yes, I know who he is.
I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
How can I know such a thing?
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtwngler today?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Yes, you remember.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
I've remembered something else...
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwngler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
Rudolf Otto Werner. Wind section since 1936. What instrument did you play?
Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
And you're from the future too?
You cold?
I caught one, back there.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
He'll find us, won't he?
Don't say that.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
So much pain.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
I don't think I like this.
And who was the enemy?
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Here, drink some of this...
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  It'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands.
Here's her driver's license.
Did you reach the next girl yet?
I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
That Silberman just crack me up.  He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire. Screwed it first, then set it on--
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
You don't talk to me like that.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Pardon me... Miss... ?
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
Home.
You deserted me.
Where are we going?
What is it?
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
Who are "they?"
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
What did you say?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
All I mean is... someone like you...
I don't know.  A lot.
Who is it?
How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
They won't...
Think about it!  They followed you every step of the way.  There was always a safety net.  The taxi, there was a diver.  At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
I didn't know what else to call you.
Julliard, yeah.
No.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
Connie... what brings you here?  Is everything alright?
For you.
Tell me where we're going.
What's this all about, Connie?
What have they been doing to you?
What?
How much is it?  A few thousand, at least.  A Rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
It's different every time.
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
Look, it was just a job.  Nothing personal, ya know?  I play my part, improvise a little.  That's what I'm good at.
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Thank you.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
What makes you ask?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Nicholas...
Because... well, I know I can trust you.
He said that Hugh Crain... Hugh Crain was a monster.  He said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  He told me that Crain drove his workers to early deaths.  Crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  And listen to this: his beautiful Rene killed herself.
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
That depends on your definition of ghosts.  I'm going to check on her, and then I'm going to stay awake.
Yeah.
Was sure she'd be in here.
All the carvings.
All right...
Like she smelled it too?
Hmm.
I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell.  A communal story.  Someone starts it.  Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  This story shapes what we see and hear.  We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it.  That's what this experiment has all been about.  That's what it was about, the experiment's over.  I'm pulling the plug.  This is my fault.
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
She needs help.
I'm not going back to New York City.  I'm going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  What about you?
What do you want?
Why do you need a chain like that?
That's where she hanged herself.
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
No.
That's so sad.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Marrow said the same thing as last night, he <u>says</u> --  -- that he checked with Mrs. Dudley.  And he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the West Wing connect to the main chimney.  He says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
Am I a thing?
As soon as you get dressed.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
Italian?
I like the colors.
What's the matter?
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
How they goin', kid?
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
What kind?
You broke last time.
Fuck you.
Oh really?  Where you from?
Edward Rama?
Who done it, then?
What more is there.
Boomerang.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
She didn't know what to say.  I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her.
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
Huh?
That was one of them?
What's so fucking funny?
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.
Had a feeling it was you.
Modelling.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
What's that, like a P.O. box.
-- Your employer?
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
You <u>have</u> been away.  Or is all this just new to you?
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
I guess you're just habitual.
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
Friends and <u>colleagues</u>.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
Yeah, I guess you are.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
A <u>statement</u>?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
Where is he now?
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'.
Hello there.
Exercising my visitation rights.
Pleasure.
Hello, Ed.
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you...
...Yes?
Hi, Mr Crane.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
But more or less.
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
You're an enthusiast.
...I wanted to make you happy.
...No, please.
Ah yes, a music lover.
...Mm.
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
...Were you in the service, Ed?
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
Your place?
...It ruined me. This money. No annex. I'm all shot to hell.
...What kind of man *are* you?
...Doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. However. I don't believe I'm *prohibited* from telling you this. I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, either. I don't exactly know.  But if *I* were the man, I'd want to be told.
Where you going?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Dave.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked about how I'd lost my place in the universe...
'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. Frankly, Doris'd be better off with the county defender.
Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I won't kid you though, Ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... And I hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking it seriously... Hmm...
...Huh?
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
Sportsmanship! That's my point. June fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? Well, what fish do you seek?
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
...You're Ed Crane?
...I'm Crane.
Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
He's a barber.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
Sweet Jesus!
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Yes.
Behind you.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Fifteen... what's next?
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
If you don't mind, this could be important.
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
How big is the sub-basement?
I think I should come with you.
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
Lieutenant!  It's me.
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Look.  It's Hobbes!  He's all right.
Oh no.  I smell it.
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
What?
What kind of egg is it?
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
How does it work?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
Dr. Whittlesley was last seen in Belem, Venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. A taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  That boat washed up in my district.  Everyone on board was killed.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
A legendary monster called Mbwun.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
Where would we find it?
What happened?
Genetic damage?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
You're not.  Where is it?
That's a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  The bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
You smell that?
No!  Don't kill him!  Pendergast, you were right.  It's John!
We're not watching the sea.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
We've become tired of watching actors give us phony emotions, bored with pyrotechnics and special effects.  While the world he inhabits is counterfeit, there's nothing fake about Truman himself.  No scripts, no cue cards.  It's not always Shakespeare but it's genuine.  That's how he can support an entire channel.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
Nothing was real.
The memory of who?
Sure she would.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
No...I, er.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
Oh, God.
What did you want?
Arrah!
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
That's right.  I do, don't I?
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Truman, what about that sign?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
Who were you talking to?!
You know surprises aren't good for me. You should really call before you come over, dear.
--Darling--
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
How's it going, Truman?
Not supposed to talk about it.
Well, we're FBI agents.
What do you do?
What am I doing here?
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
You've been back to Dallas?
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
This man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
My lateness may have well been absence. A course has already been taken.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
Have you examined them?
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
How's that?
Who sent you?
And what's that?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
You're saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
You know my work?
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
What killed those men?
A plague?
Negotiating with whom?
How can I reach you?
That would be my guess.
You told me you had answers.
No. I haven't.
Alright... what'll it be: Coke, Pepsi? A saline IV?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
...thirteen fifty six...
They were the ones that put us together.
What did you find?
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
How was it contracted?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Been where?
I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I have. I did. It's done.
Scully...
I can't go any farther.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Where is he?
Let me out. Stop the car.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
I do it all the time!
Nothing.
I still don't understand why I can't do this... This isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
Agent Novak?
It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
Evil.
What happened?
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
Where the hell are we?
That went well.
He's mine?
Oh no... No you don't.
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
Any psychiatric medication?
How's the patient.
We proceed assuming she is.
Why jeopardize what we've already done? We caught the sonofabitch.  Carl Stargher.  That's going to be like Bundy, Gacy, Dahmer.  A case that makes careers.  But if we push our luck.  If this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
Den leuten.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
You were awfully good.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
His own doctor?
...at all.
Do I...
...and buried him.
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Have you seen Calloway?
...and my lover. He was Harry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?
How do you know?
Oh, well.
...quarrel?
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
Yes.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Where?
How will I know you?
What is it?
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
...to him.
Why don't you catch a few murderers for a change?
Listen, Callaghan.
...expense.
A parrot bit me.
So would I.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Calloway, can't you do something about Anna?
Write her out a receipt, Paine. Give her a receipt for these letters too.
...of Santa Fe."
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Striptease, sir.
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
Hello, Harry.
I want to talk to you.
Hmm.
...exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?
Unwise, Holly...
What do you want me to do?
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
Have you ever seen any of your victims?
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
...the best way one can, you know.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Thank you.
Speak English?
Coffin?
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
...Popescu...
I was told that he did not die at once.
The Roumanian?
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
Oh, you did.
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
Should I make it all fact?
Where are you staying?
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Bonjour.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
Big?
Bonsoir.
Hi.
So from there to there?
We lost our key.
Exactly. Always happened to someone else.
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
They only kill them when they love them?
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Fucking Danny, man...
What, do you like it here?
Do we have to listen to this shit?
How come you know all this shit?
Yeah, but not on the letters.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
Is he a Nazi?
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
Why should I submit?
Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
Nazis talk about it all the time.
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
That's a much easier game.
Why are you taking that?
...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but...
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker.
The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
Jewish girls like to give head, right?
Because the Jew is essentially female.
Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Give me a reason not to.
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
I always won.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
Think about your father. Your sister.
Don't tell me what I --
No!
What part of Germany are you people from?
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
How have things been going?
He's going to die.  He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around.  I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble.
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people...
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
Which one were you aiming at?
Shut up. Fuck you....
What about Drake, did he ever show up?
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Who'd you kill?
Shoot him in the head. Always shoot a Jew in the head.
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Where do you think you're going?
Who's this?
Howard Stern.
Adam Sandler.
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
We want you to help run it. Give speeches, lead seminars... Handle the fund-raising.
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
Oh, fuck you...
What do you mean?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
Did you tell him?
No!
He seems to have won it.
This is a great pleasure.
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
And the lights!  Running lights, stealing stretchers...!  You'll have us in jail.
... Not yet.
Is he alright?  What happened?
Dollars.
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Santini will do that for 25 dollars!
What about the shoes?
Plenty of women everywhere right?
It isn't lit yet.
And... does the voice come back?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
I dove 315 feet!
Why?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Enzo?
Madame...
No.
Why?
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
You don't have that one, do you?
Anybody can have a bad day!
Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
A drink to warm up?
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
I'd better get back now.
How are you?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Then, tell me a story.
Hello?
You sure?
You'll try again tomorrow?
What's wrong?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.
Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
In my apartment?
How was your trip?
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
Does that have a hidden meaning?
What is it honey... the frenchy?
... And those?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
My dear, science is a cruel mistress.
Will he understand Spanish?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
Wait!  Professor...?
It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Please. Will you help me?
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Any sign of Santa?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Sorry. I'm better with men.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
When did you guys have this conversation? When I was in the bathroom? What else did she have to say?
Esther!
You two know each other?
You watch your back Hammer. Hanukkah might just be his first move. For all we know Kwanzaa could be next. There's a lot of brothers counting on you. If you fail...
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine?
Get off of me you cripple!
What day is it?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and -
Nobody. A boy who works in a grocery.
Mmmyes.
Is he in love with you?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
I want him to lock me up.
North -- in an arroyo, Shot through the head - maybe week ago. No good, skin, everything gone 
And here is Three Tree Mesa -- and here I go out of the big arroyo --
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
What, senorita?
You know all about these things - - and I've lived here all my life - and I still don't know what the Procession means.
It doesn't jibe with this  you told me the leopard would go out into the country - it wouldn't stay in the city 
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
To the eye? Like other men.
No. He would be a hard man to find, Jerry. Particularly if he were a clever men. He would go about his ordinary business calmly and coolly except when the fit to kill was on him.
It was you.
You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --
Why did you give up teaching?
So you see meeting you is a real thrill for me.
Of course. Only I'm afraid you'll be cheated. There isn't much of a view of the procession here.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Chief, don't you understand what this means?
You won't go to Galbraith with me?
Get it out of here!
It must be the altitude  you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of bootandsaddle boys --
Who is he?
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
I got into a little crap game.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Good afternoon. De Moraess residence.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Get out of my house. Youre fired, Mr Lombard.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. Ill give it 24 hours. He just might show up.  If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
When did you get back?
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Whatever the reason, Im sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
Huh! Dont you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
Leons not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leons found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned Id exceeded his expectations.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
One just doesnt... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Is there anything to understand?
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
Why the hell couldnt you divorce the man?
Okay. The woman just cant walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why cant you go to your Embassy?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my sons. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... Theres some cold chicken salad in the fridge if youre hungry.
Get a pen and dont ask any questions.
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily.  This should cover what you lent me.
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Im calling about the puppies.
Why?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
So, what are you looking for?
Im afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
Whats this place? A hotel of some kind?
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
What colour is your car?  What colour is your car?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Hello there. Hows the flat. I cleaned...
Piss off!
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
Any friends?
Youre out of your mind. Whats the idea?
Maybe I dont.
Is this Friedman?
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
At what time will you be available?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
A private investigator... Youre not Austrian?
Whats a French private investigator doing here?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Is she on the phone?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?
I hear youre looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leons gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
Whats an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Three...
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
What sums?
Very funny. Can I go on now?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
I would like some fresh straw.
And I would like to see a priest.
Better today than tomorrow.
What did they say?
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
We must sound the retreat!
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
No...
Go onto the next question.
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?
Quick -- hide in here...
Don't worry about me -- just stay in here... and don't move!
Trial?  What trial??
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
How old are you?
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Your majesty, I urge you not to see this woman.  It all reeks of a Burgundian trap!
But if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  By what he said?
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
What's going on?
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
You look disappointed... Isn't this what you wanted?
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
When you were taken prisoner at Compiegne, did you have a horse?
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
What signs?
No.  That was a sword in a field.
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Is that bad?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Then... why are you here so often?
I want to be with him always...
I'm going to get a doctor.
Hello.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
I need help.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Have you seen this?
Henryk's in there.
Believe me, they've picked him up.
Can you help?
And suppose they take the table away?
What's this about?
And, please, tonight, for once, I don't want anything bad talked about. Let's enjoy our meal.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
I know.
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
Otherwise what?
No one thought they'd hold out so long.
Jehuda, give me something to do.
But I want to help, I want to.
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
Yes, I know, but Jurek, Jurek...
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
Where are you hiding?
Are the Russians here?
What about you?
Szpilman.
Watch your feet!
Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done.  You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! 
I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around.
Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave.
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
Don't answer, he low born. Jun look at him, mongrel. Your wife where she?
I worry for you.
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
No, words. You have never heard words?
She wants it to come.
We can't leave the piano
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
And when is the next lesson?
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
Twist, you know this guy?
Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
Then why ain't he dead?
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
I know I give him four threes.  We can't let him get away with that.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?
You just worry about your end, kid.
You think he'll show?
Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
I better do some packin'.  I'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.
Looks like he's sulking.
Who are you?
What time you get off work here?
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
You really picked a winner, kid.
Well, what did I tell ya?
We want to talk to ya about Henry Gondorff.
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
Well we do.  He's chummin' around with a Big C named Henry Gondorff. Ring any bells?
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
What?
Mind if I look around?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
I can't.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
What is it? Has he found him?
What is it?
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Don't.  It's horrible.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
Did he tell you where he was going?
Not that scrawny little....? 
Your father?
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
Come on in.
There. 
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Yes.
Did you kill her?
This gun yours?
What about the suicide?
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
He's holding out on you.
Trail him!  Trail who?
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles?  He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
Could this be him?
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
That's ridiculous.
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
I'll get some.
I know.
Chris!
I couldn't go near that woman.
That's my business.
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
I can't! I haven't got it!
I got word from Wynant this morning...
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
You don't say --
I have no right to answer that.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
You did... where?
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
All right - you didn't.
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
So it's you he was after!
Who is she?
How many drinks have you had?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
But it's Christmas now.
It's all right.  It just grazed me.
You're a fine watch dog.
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
He's just been for a walk.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
What do you mean?
Nick!
How long has he been dead?
I'm going to tell her.
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
Why are you saying it?
Bonds, sir?
Home?
What's in the other direction?
Like learning Arabic?  You're gonna learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
We've got rope?
All right.  Let's get out of here.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Where'd they go?
You ready?
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
Stop it!
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
I'm not going to let you kill him.
It's a combat action.
Then step aside.
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps?  Like I said; I expected more from you.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.
You think?
It's war.  People get lost all the time in war, cut off--
Invest it.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
What?
It'd make their heads explode.
SAY IT!
What!?
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
There's a way.
How's this going to work?
You're going to be fine.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
I don't hear any--
Well, it's Iraq.  I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that has something to do with them being here.
Where the hell is it!?
It looks like you're not doing anything.
Must be a compartment.
Maybe we should blast it loose with the claymore.
Wait.
He's not going to leave us.
Why do I have to stay down here?
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.
We should head Northeast.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
And you; you've got it all together.
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
Sorry.
Getting cold.
What do you figure it is?
Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
We can head back for our lines, and they don't even have to know about the gold.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
An Iraqi?
What do we do?
What do you make of them?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
Can you ride a horse?
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
He's not slowing.
Woods.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
Spanish wasn't hard enough?
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
Jaeger?
We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
We...we could go home with something else.
You're not saying what I think you're saying.  I can't believe you're even thinking it.
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
We're not stranded.  We've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back.
Jesus!  What the hell did he do that for? They're Iraqis.  Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis?
We're American soldiers.  We don't abandon people.
What the hell are you doing!?
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
You're going to burn up in those.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
I'm not hungry.
You know I don't feel well.
Now?
I haven't done anything.
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
I'll try.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.
They're watching us now.
What?
Wait!  I'll talk to him.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
Where's LUH?
You're in violation.
What are you doing here?  You're not cleared for this area!
What are you doing here?
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
Remember this...?
Yes.
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
Just do it.
Where did you get this?
What?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
Right.
Why do you do it?
Ex-girlfriend?
Good, now the other side.
More metal... sharp edge...
What's wrong?
Yeah, another round thing.
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
Computer device?
Cover.  It was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. No one was suppose to get hurt. The night you busted us...We were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. Scare them away.
No... No more killing.
Drop it.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
You touch me again and--
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
Mike...
It don't work-
Reilly, Vice. I-
Make an appointment.
So what're we looking for?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Look, I saw these guys, I can i.d. them.
What's this?
Yes.
Well, have you found it?
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
No!
<u>Niente!</u>
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
But--
Nice day, Major.
You're looking fine, Major.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Yes, Baron.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
I want to see-- 
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
Two weeks and three days.
Monescu.
Thank you, Major. 
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
Thank you!
The fourteenth of May.
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
They're all right, aren't they?
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
yse seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company! 
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Naturally I did.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
What shade of powder do you use?
That's too dark.
Do you know my first name?
Oh? 
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
It's disgraceful!
The same thing.
Then riding together.
Marvelous.
Crimson!
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
Yes, I would!
Then why do you want to go?
Ah, let me have a little fun.
You look beautiful.
Mariette!
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
Right!
But you're the more intelligent one.
No--I'm sorry.
Yes, I saw it--but--
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Good luck to you, Rose.
Who's the best? Say it.
Shit.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
What?
There's a satellite call for you.
None of the stewards have seen her.
I make my own luck.
What could possible be funny?
You know I don't like that, Rose.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
This should be amusing.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
Cor... look at that, would ya.
You're distracting me. Go away.
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
HELP! HELP!!
Hello again.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
So don't marry him.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
What is it? A sapphire?
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
It's bad.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
You have to go for help.
I'm not going without you.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
Never let go.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
I'm sorry.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Oh--a hundred times--
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
You'll excuse me. 
You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
Did you find it?
What did you want a gun for?
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
Aces full.
Nice lines--
Like her paint job?
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
There's soft music--
Don't rub it in.
What are you thinking?
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
Who with?
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Well, I'll be--!!!
Not here--follow me around the shed.
We coulda got two third-class!
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
You don't think--?
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Not a chance.
Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
Shortie!--you know my motto?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Say--wait a minute!
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
Three Jacks.
How's your mother feeling?
Care to join us?
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
Hello, young fellow!
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Where do you live?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
That's me!
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
Oh, there you are--
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
I didn't--
Am I a member of this club?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
--And he has sex appeal.
Get that out of your trunk.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?
What happened to you?
That's him! That's the sucker!!
How much did you lose?
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
No!
Congratulations.
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
I was in his cabin--
Nothin'.
Ain't got time.
God damn son of a...
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
I saw that look pass between you And Wyatt at the fight.  Listen to Me!  You're mine!  Understand? You're my woman and I'm your man.
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
He said to turn loose of him.
Where'd you get that horse?
I asked where you got him.
I'm retired.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
Forget it.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
Here, Doc.
What's wrong, Doc?
We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
Very cosmopolitan.
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
Wyatt, my God!  You're shot to pieces!
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
When will you wake up?  You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
Wyatt, I... I ain't got the words.
There they go.  Look kinda like preachers.
What is it?
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Just answer.
Just doesn't, that's all.
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
You see that bird at the faro Table?  That's Johnny Tyler.  He Barged in here one day, said he Was takin' over the game, started Slappin' customer, wavin' his Gun around, scarin' off all the High-class play.  Only trade comes In here now's just bummers and Drovers, just the dregs.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
'Least you admit it.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Get down, boy.
I just got it fixed.
That a fact?
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new Money Ward, too.  33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch.  'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne.  Now there's six Of 'em.  This is like a bad dream.
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
But -
Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects...  Especially one with such distinguished friends.
Mr. Bond! Nice to see you.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
I'm sure they will.
In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Yes. And do try to keep all four of them on the road.  All the usual refinements: Smoke, missiles, machine guns -  Fully operational remote control. Drives forward, reverse -  Stop that!  Plus infrared thermal imaging radar, heads up instrumentation, and 17 beverage cup holders.
Wait a minute -
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
Do you feel better now?
Paris -
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this?
Can you arrange a meeting?
... Does this do anything?
And what do you call this?
Wait here.
Down?
Sometimes you just have to -
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?
And number two?
Thank you Colonel Everhart.  007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information?
- Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. -
What do you make of all this?
I was just getting to the interesting part!
How sweet.
Take the men. I can finish alone.
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
What the hell is going on?
Please sir. Please -
What about ID's?
Oh, no.
What time is it? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave? It's after one.
What did your wife get her?
Why, you don't want us to bring him over?
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
Linda, how come you don't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right?
It was nip and tuck.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
My mind plays tricks on me. Is it okay if I take a bath now?
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
How is the garden doing?
What did you put on it?
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Good afternoon, ladies.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Hocker's death almost caused a race riot. A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
Is this your house?
I appreciate you lending me a hand. That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
You don't want to be at crossroads without one. It's a charm that old people teach you how to make. I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it ever since she was a child.  In my travels I misplaced it. I have been looking over my shoulder ever since.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
When did you talk to Harry?
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
I didn't mean for you to pay me for that.
To infinity and beyond!
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Which one can I open first?
Oh, hey - it was nothing.
You'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
Hello-o-o...
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
Can!
And another thing.  Stop with this spaceman thing.  It's getting on my nerves.
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
What's going on?
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Right?  Buddy?
C'mon, c'mon, that's it...
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
What happened to you?
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Why, sure you can, Buzz.  You can get me out of here and then I'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for Andy's house.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Hold on, Woody!
MOM!!  MOM!!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I'm not worried.  You shouldn't be worried.
A lunchbox?!
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
No!  No, no, no, no!
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Uh, hey Sarge, have you seen Slinky?
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
He can't abide a woman in trousers. He says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
Mummy was scared of him, I think. He went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
He'll murder you when he finds out.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Surely she is older?
I already lost everything once.
Did you do this?
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
How much?
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very adept at being on my own.  I've always had a man in my life.  Always.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
Hi.
How's David?
Where is it?  Where are the drugs?  Where are they?
Live with your parents?
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
She knows Arnie Metzger.
What do we do?
Women's room, stall two.  Should we stop for ice-cream?
Yes.
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
We aren't barbarians.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
I don't think you're going to do that.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
That's good coke.
Does this offer include my partner?
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
She's not at that place you sent her?
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
I just want to be clear about one thing.  I used to work for him, but now I work for you.  I'm not a partisan person, I'm an issue person. In the next few weeks, if you allow me, we'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues.  The most important of which, in my opinion, being Mexico.  I know everybody that you're gonna meet. It's important that they like you. It's not important that they like me.  That's why I can help protect you.
Did you tell him?
Well, I've not brought them.
Well, I've not brought them.
All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
It's a scandal, Franco.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Where's that?
Great.
What?
Well, it isn't.
So, what's he like?
I read it in Cosmopolitan.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
I bet Lizzy told him where to put it.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Are you getting out much?
Have you got any gear on you?
Thanks, Mark.
Good luck, Spud.
Now remember --
If they think you're not trying, you're in trouble. First hint of that, they'll be on to the DSS, 'This cunt's no trying' and your Giro is fucking finished, right?
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
Director?
Who wrote it?
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
I don't rate that at all.
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
Eughh. Sounds horrible.
Did he -- you know?
You know.
I can't believe you did that.
How much?
The Sick Boy method.
That's hardly a substitute.
It's the great outdoors.
How's it going with Gail?
Useless motherfucker, that's what she called me. I told her, I'm sorry, but theses things happen. Let's put it behind us.
Yes, but then she finds out I've bought a ticket for Iggy Pop the same night.
A walk.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Why? Why have you done this to my friend?
The ship....
I couldn't help but notice you pain.
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
Admit it. We're lost.
Um... yes. We've been caught in a blizzard!
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
No, but you can bet they will.
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
But how?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Ah, Captain?
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
Oh, God
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Captain?
Jim.
Yes, Captain.
What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
To land any closer would risk detection.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
Spock.
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
You must allow us to act.
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There, you see? See?
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
There's got to be a way out of this place.
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
Maybe he's not out there, Bones. Maybe he's right here... in the human heart  Spock?
I trust your message was received?
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
Spock...  What have you done to my friends?
Your vision?
You are mad!

I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Each man's pain is unique.
I know you better than that.
Spock?
I don't get it.
Beautiful!
Yeah...?
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
What do you mean, "'yes"?
You said it.
Flynn?
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
What, just the three of us?
Flynn!!
But -- if you're a User -- then everything you've done has been part of a plan ...
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
We're on our way.  Alan-One gave me the coding we need to go up against Master
Hey... you guys OK?
Flynn, we've got to help him!
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
So...how's the world of serious science?
Sure, I'd love to go up against some of these guys ... be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me. Which branch of the service?
A User?
But-what if I can't...?
New guy...
You think we can make it there?
Yori... hey...
My quarters.
Yes...it can take us across the Sea of Simulation... all the way out of the Game Grid...to the MCP.
Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
Son of a bitch!
Uh huh.  And her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  I				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
She's importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
Station wagon?
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
I thought this look like your work.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.
So, it was your first time.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.
Especially in this light.  This is the only light they had then,				* so I like to study it this way. I love this place.  I love all ruins.
Yes.
What did you tell him?
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
Now slide the nylons off one by one.
I'm sorry, honey.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
What does she do?
Sooooo... she's pretty good in bed, then?
I said SIT DOWN.  Who do you work for?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
Hello?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Worse than Cairo?							*
That was you?!
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
You see what I mean?  That reaction would give us away in a second.  Try to relax.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
It's a good thing you pay me well.
Who is this woman?
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
The forager's back.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
How long have you worked here?
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Who and what is a Drexl?
Where you goin', honey?
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
I think what you did was...
I think what you did...
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
I'm hip.
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!
Yeah.
That's a pretty amazing story.
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Is he big league?
Elliot what?
The zoo.
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
What the fuck did you bring that for.
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
What do you think, eightball?
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I've seen him.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Could we try it now?
Where'd he come from?
Do you believe him?
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
Suspect's words -
He saw the wire.
What was I sayin'?
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
You gotta hold this for me.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
No.
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
Well?
Him?  You saw that man?
The food, the sky, the certain, uh, sexual temptations -- you haven't become "addicted" have you, Cole?  To that "dying" world'
We're very close!  Because of you!
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
They forced me to take drugs.
Do you know why you're here, James.
I see.  You don't remember assaulting a police officer...several officers?
Do you know what year it is?
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
No, I think it was always you.  It's very strange.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!
The guy was a total fruitcake.
What made you think that?
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
I need help all right.  They're coming after me.
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
The gun! ... I lost it
Okay...you were standing there looking at the moon...you were eating grass... then what?
Just like that?  You were in prison?
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
Why are we doing this?
I know this place! ... This is my dream.
What....???
County Hospital, right?  1989.  The "Immaculate Escape" -- am I right?  Why, thank you -- you look wonderful, too.
JOSE!
Jo...Jose????
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
He kidnapped you, Kathryn.  You saw him murder someone.  You knew there was a real possibility he would kill you, too.  You were under tremendous emotional stress.
You have him in restraints.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
I think I've heard that before.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Any parting words of wisdom?
Where to?
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
You want somethin'?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
Hey!
How much time?
What time is it now?
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
Two-hundred.
Yeah, but it was shot.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
What was that all about?
Ned!  Now look at what you done! Are you all right?
Taking a little trip?
Is that right?  Can't say as I blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  I know I've had my fill of this town.  Sixteen years I've been the law and order here.  So long I forgot why I ever wanted the job in the first place.  Help people, I guess.  Keep the peace.  Problem is there's so much peace around here they don't much need me.  Got a lot of speeders, but they're speeding through miles of nothing so I can't hardly blame them.  Other than that, well, there ain't much to steal.  I reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say Mrs. McKenna?  A murder?
I put up new drapes, Jake.
They look nice.
I don't hear anything.  You were dreaming.  Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Jake, what is that?
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Jesus.
No, I've got it.
Yes, I have.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
Where you headed?
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
Where'd you learn to do that?
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.
You love him?
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
Lied?  What do you mean?
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Shit!
Why the hell didn't you do anything?
Oh, that's great.  We killed Jake because you heard him talk about some money that you've never seen. That's fucking brilliant!
There's easily a hundred-thousand in there.  More than that.
Let's go in the bedroom.
To get my car.
John . . .?
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
John!
What happened to your hand?
I'm a solid man.
What brings you to Sierra?
Live there?
Hey!
Would you?
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
Talk?  About what?
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
You meant it.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
Drop it, Jake.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
Two-hundred dollars.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
You're fucked.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
The old lady?
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Fucking kid.  And look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  You're a Neanderthal.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
What'd you think, boy?  That you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  Not by a long shot.  You're just the most gullible.  How much did you get?
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
What?
Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
I wasn't doing anything.
Mister!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
California...
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
How much could you get?
I need thirteen.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Next time you'll do just fine.
I guess this is what they call "ironee"? Hunh?
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
Two-hundred dollars?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Harlin around?
Will he be back soon?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
How much time?
Nothing.
What the hell happened to my car?
Hundred-fifty.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Look, Harlin.
What you want?
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
Soda.  You got any soda?
That's right on my way.
I don't know your real name.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
Wasn't nothing.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You never did answer my question.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
Darrell?  You know he and Jake are...
Where?
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace. 
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
I can't see it.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
And I love you too.
Seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  You're not planning on staying are you?
"Arkady"
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
Mr. Arkady, honest, I ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. So now I don't have a cent to my name. I can't even get my car out of the garage.  I tell you, Mister...  if it weren't for bad luck I wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   So, I was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so I could get my car out of this garage, see?  The bus depot here has a Western Union thing.  And of course I'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
One way, or round trip?
You got a beer?
Beck's.
Genuine Draft?
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't!
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.
I axed you a question.
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
Once again please?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
I don't know. It's been a while.
When was the last time I wore pink?
Oh shit...
Megan?
...When you work with clients on machines, do they sometimes just jump up a level or two? Do something they didn't know they were capable of?
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
I'm not sure.
What's he talking about?
I assumed because of the train.
At the church... You were following me weren't you?
What do you want?
Just give me a minute.
Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
I have to go now.
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
Dunne, it's Jenkins, we got a guy at gate 17C with a bogus ticket. Says he knows you. He won't tell me his name.
I'm going to go in.
Why'd you do that?
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
I'm sleeping in my room.
I'm not scared.
What a coincidence? I'm a male synchronized swimmer and I'm looking for representation.
He doesn't look very threatening.
How are you feeling?
How so?
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
You just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
You told them cowboys you had it.
He said...
Now this Strawberry Alice person, tell me again.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
Oh. How long I been here?
Are you really going to kill them?
Free ones?
Charley, see what kind of "books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
You leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
Mmmm pistols.
Uh... a little, maybe.
What's all that wood?
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
All week?
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
What?
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
He's... he's dead.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
N-no, sir?
Yeah, I guess so.
Maybe I ain't.
Don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. Don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Three ways, I figured.
You're goin' back with him?
An' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  Uncle Pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
Finish him, Ned.
When we gonna double back?
That was... the first one.
Take a drink, Kid.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
HEY, KID.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
I seen her... I seen Claudia too...
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
Three.
That fella come by... Tom.
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
No... I meant...
What was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
Clouds, Kid. We was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
His pistol must of jammed.
Depends what he told you.  About Bill, you mean?
There was ninety-one million -
What was the money for?
&lt;&lt;No, no, no. I need a guarantee from the ridiculous man. I am going to be killed. I have seen the Devil and looked him in the eye.&gt;&gt;
Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
They want more time to think about investing.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
Come home, Dean.
Fuck you. I'11 never shit right again. So who did it? Own up.
You're fuckin' A right, no P.C. Well screw P.C. No right. No goddamn right. You do some time, they never let you go. Treat me like a criminal, I'll end up a criminal.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
How do you do?
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
You watch your mouth.
How are they going to do it?
No killing?
What-are they speaking?
Ready?
with what?
My employer requires your services. One job. One day's work. Very dangerous. I don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.
I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
A little of both.
The job got thrown to me by this lawyer.
What do you mean I can't see him?
Weapons. Misdemeanor two.
I'11 find him.
I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
Oh come on, Verbal. Who do you think you're talking to? You really expect me to believe he retired? For a woman? Bullshit. He was using her.
Came from Redfoot.
I've got immunity now. What can you possibly offer me?
What call?
Don't shine me, Verbal. No more stalling. You know what I'm getting at.
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
Edie...
You're not safe on your own.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
What are you doing here?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
And what did your team do...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Dr. Thompson, just so the Jury knows, you never treated Deborah Ann Kaye.  Is that correct?
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
Mr. Concannon...?
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
You are aware of the penalties for perjury...?
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
It's all right, Mickey.
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
I didn't do too well for you.
You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
I read the hospital report on your client.
Yes.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
Thank you ...
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Who are you protecting, then?
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Listen to me, fella...
Nothing further, your Honor...
I can't guarantee that...
Mr. Galvin's...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Would you like me to leave...?   Is this a bad time --?
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Well, then what are you doing here?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe.  Believe me. You say you're going to lose.  Is it my fault?  Listen!  The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
Hi, Mickey ...
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
How are you holding up?
That's right.
Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
...four years ago...
... I'm sure you do ...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Uh-huh.  My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
Who told you that?
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
A single hour.
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
You don't have to do it for a living.
How can I see her, to know her?
Ernie's.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Hello?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
I told you! Right here!
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Thank you again. Good-night.
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
I don't like it!
Come here.
Can't you see?
I'm scared.
Love me... keep me safe...
Where were you?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Oh... wandering about.
Please drink your coffee.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
I hope we will, too.
Good-bye.
No.
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
Do you know where you're going?
How old?
Why?
Do you hear anything?
And no birds sing.
Have you been here before?
No, I can't tell you!
Take me away from here?
What do you remember?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
Yes --
Tell me.
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Here with you.
My love... because I love you.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Why?
Where?
You believe that I love you?
Let me go into the church alone.
Is there something I can do for you?
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
Oh, but she hasn't been here today. Scottie whirls back on her.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
I had to quit, Midge.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
I think I can lick it.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
I've told you enough.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
Yes! That's it!
I said how's it going?
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Name one.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
What are you doing?
What do you think you are doing?
We have to call the ambulance.
Are you sure this was an accident?
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Just stop.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Her fucking head was caved in.
Wait. Wait a minute.
We can't do this.
So that's what we're doing.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing. It's not. It's not a good thing. But it was, given the circumstances, the smart play. We did what had to be done. And...well...I'm proud of us. I'm proud of each and every one of us. We performed. Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations, we stood fast and we delivered. I feel proud.
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
Where's the candy?
No way.
Money?
Actually, no. Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled his medical exam...and failed to make his last payment...so his Term Life lapsed. So it's value is null and void.  Now he did have a pension account, worth another 150 thousand.
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.
What is it?
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Your investment ideas never work out.
I don't think so Boyd.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
He's right.
We need padded chairs.
Nobody knows she's here.
I said, what have we done?
Okay. Here's the deal and it's a good one. Lois is cool. It's a pacified situation.
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
Whatever you say Kojak.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
You're a fucking moron.
The hell I did!
Nope.
Your ideas never work out.
Take Mexico.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Can't we do it on the phone?
Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
Florist?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
He's a great chef.
Keith do not trivialize this.
Not padded ones.
I need your help.
Where are you?
What about the chairs?
The chairs.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of your fucking mind?!
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
What?
What kind of stupid question is that?
You killed a prostitute.
He kept saying he was protected.
So what do we do?
I don't care for him.
I'm getting married...
Where did you get that?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
If I was to think...If I were to think... No I mean I have thinked it over...I have. And without putting a lot of pressure on you I just...Well I just...
That ought to be about the end of that.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.
There.
That's a good one.
We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
She's dead.
Right.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.
I'll come to you tonight.
Where's the camera?
Take me there.
How long are you staying?
How did you know about that?
Yes, it is.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
Leave us alone, Ramona.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
How much is that?
If you wake first, wake me up.
What are you thinking about?
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know, sir.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
Well... is it so urgent?
What do you know about me?
Don't say that.
There's been an accident.
Yes -- very, very big!
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
Have I slept long?
How did you see me?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
She's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
I'm not sure. My guess is that's what Sid wants us to think.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
What's the assignment?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
What happens if I can't catch him?
What did you find out?
Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel. I don't know where...
You embarrassed me in front of the highestranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
I haven't been working on anything.
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
It was you, wasn't it?
A little less than yesterday.
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
You ready for this?
He was reenacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
What are you doing?
I am the demon from the bottomless pit...
This is getting you pumped up, isn't it? This is like the World Series to you.
What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the sonof-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
She's beautiful, you know?
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
Sounds to me like a welleducated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
Don't worry about it, all right?
You know I am.
Parker - stop! STOP! Don't make me shoot you
Grimes is back! He's back! He's come back!!!
He didn't know about the neural toxin.  I did.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
See something?
Find out anything?
Where the hell are you going?
What C-4...was Cox talking about?
There you go  best seat in the house.
...tonight...
It's the White House.
No, this is great.
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant?  Is she?  Can I see her "chart?"  Because...
Hey, hey, I'm just the Producer, I'm just the <u>Stationmaster</u>, Johnny Green wrote that song, and...
...The Albanian Campaign...
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
It won't hold.
What would do that...?
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
...they sound what?
Precisely.
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  It was a put-up job?  But where was the, where was the money in that?
...can we see the Kitten...?
Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
Yes.  That's true.  But...
I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
How long you been up, you need a nap.
<u>Nashville</u>...?
No.  I was busy.  Yes, I need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  I'll call in from Nashville.  And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...?  I've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>They</u> sure let us out of there easy....
That's not bad at all.
Oh, MiGod.
I was acting as a Private Citizen.  Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with.  Or in whose <u>employ</u>...
...where is my pill?
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
This is nothing. ...piece of cake.  Y'know, producing is being a Samurai Warrior.  They pay you, day in, day out, for Years, so that, ONE DAY, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training At Its Peak, and save the day.
Would somebody wake me in five minutes?
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
...Yes.
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Remember the Maine...
N'it's a crying shame.  But you <u>staged</u> the Oscars...
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
King, King, I got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than Hattie McDaniel. Now:
Three-o-three...
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.
Inaugural Speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
Yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  I'm slowing down...  No, no.  Look, lookit:  I think it's a mistake, well, I'll <u>tell</u> you why:  you got'em by the balls, <u>Squeeze</u>.  Because Schumann's the Shark.  He's ...<u>Jaws</u>.  You have to <u>tease</u>'em... You don't puttem in the first reel of the movie...  Bring'em back <u>slow</u>, the President...  No, no, put him on.  Put him on.  President wants to reveal Scbumann before the election.
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
The Albanian Campaign.
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
...what happened...?
You can't tell this story.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
Don't tune it too good.
We got the guy, we got the guy, we got the Guy!
It's like those Japanese in the Caves on Okinawa... didn't believe the War was Over.
...what do you got?
Albania, Albania, Albania, James bond Villains.
They guard our, <u>you</u> know ... "borders," night and day...
...by you?
The Special Anti-Terrorist Detachment of the Border Patrol... what do they <u>do</u>...?
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
Long's you git me back for the beans...
Gordon, the insurance people are balking on the logging trucks...
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm celebrating tonight.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
I gotta feeling we're going to make a killing today, Marv.
Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got it all upside down.  Okay, I'm giving this to you and you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for you. Take the Knicks against the Bullets, and my pick of the day -- Duke to beat the spread against Wake Forest.
What the hell...
What's going on?
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Speak English will ya.
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
The FAA announcement.
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet.
What if they call him?
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Yeah, right...
....Relax Roget  You're 82M in the account numbers and I'm the Invisible Man... they're always looking for red flags, Gekko's always getting checked by them, they never come up with anything... we're invulnerable on this...
So what firm you with, pal?
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. We're going into a new age pal. So how's business today.
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
Got him at an auction in Kentucky.
Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I know my way around, I have friends there...inside.
Last night I read Rudy the story of Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot. Know what happened: he stuck his nose in that honey pot once too often and got stung.
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
Where is it?
What if I have a previous engagement?
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Do you think you're ready?
...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
You got a look in your eye, Mr. Mannheim... You got something for the small fry...
You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you gotta get to the big time first, then you can be a pillar and do good things.
I can't...and I won't.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
He respond to the offer? What? What the hell's Cromwell doing giving lecture tours when his company's losing 60 million a quarter? I guess he's giving lectures on how to lose money...if this guy opened a funeral parlor, no one would die, this turkey's totally brain dead...Well Christmas is over and business is business.  Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch. Ollie I want every orifice in his body flowing red.
With all due respect, Mr. Gekko, what's to prevent you from doing the same thing?
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
We need to talk. CHINA Yeah about what?
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Yes, I guess you're right
We're all here, and ready sir!
Hello?
I hope you enjoyed your visit.
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.
Oh that explains everything.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
Well?
This time I really don't see anyone man.
Can this be stopped?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
That was very good.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
What?
I didn't want to come.
Fireball?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
Toward the end.  You remember?
Who are you?
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
Would you like some iced tea?
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Just plain old coffee.  None of that mocha nonsense.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
Wow.
You should have heard her play.
How you holding up?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Jody--
Thanks, but I'm fine.
You think he killed her?
I have to go.
Does Norman know?
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
Christ, that's twice in...When did they move in?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Excellent.  Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
Tired?
Wanna fool around?
I just wish you could have heard her.
Did you call the police?
It was there.  This angry music all by itself.  And I heard whispering.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
Did you tell her?
You didn't?
Sorry.  You understand.
Where is she then?
When you do this, I swear...
What are you doing?
How do you know this?
Who did?
How did you--
The accident...?
I'm sorry...
You know I am.
We walked all night...
A cheap wine glass from the caterers.  You started crying.  I tried to comfort you...
I was there.
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
I never asked you to quit!
THAT'S NOT TRUE!  You wanted to quit!  And then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
What?
Look for antiques...
Do you know it?
What?
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
I have seen him again.  Last night.
With his hands!
How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
A what...?
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
I am with you, my love. Like no other can ever be.
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
If that were true, I would not be here.
A girl...?
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Do not tell me that!
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
Only you...
Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
Yessss...
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
Harder...
It's unbelievable that you can do that.
I was born, in New Orleans, too-
Stop it.
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
What about your work back home...?
I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Wanna snack...?
Gee - look at that.  I didn't know alligators came this far up on shore
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
Is he - is he gonna die...?
If it's a boy --- Taylor.
Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
Lasher...  Where --- where is ---
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
I thought someone was following me - I - er -  I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
Sounds good - thank you
And it can't be forged?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
I don't know
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
I don't know
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
Tell me how it happened...
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
What?
Yes...
Where are you going?
Well, what do you think?
What's wrong with you?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
I thought it was you - how are you?
Good - I've got to dash -  Say that I said hello to ELLEN for me would you...
Dead?
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe.
I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents.
Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
...A bouncer? Are you serious?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
I can't believe that's your mother. We're talking babe-a-licious chub fest, right here in the 501's.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
So far away? In Xenia?
Hurry.
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.
Don't be such a pansy. All of this is YOURS.
You got everything you ever wanted.
Never say never.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
I mean, what do you think?
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
Sorry I--
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
I-I don't have the keys.
You do know how to drive?
Teddy? I was thinking.
Ted! Do something!
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad.
Can you believe that was me?
So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed.
James, what are you doing here?
My new bike.
I miss them, too.
I didn't know they gave them for Best Lip Gloss Retention During a Blow Job.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
Well? What do you think of her?
Wow...you clean up nice.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I mean my father.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
That's probably my office.
Tell me more.
I see.
Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do.
I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
Well? Surprised?
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
With all due respect to Merk, he doesn't have to read my magazine. But he has no right to stop others.  Ever hear of the First Amendment?
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
I do?
You were the new and improved you.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
I loved my brother. I stood by his wishes to let his son run the company. A son he never knew. A son that he and his wife gave away at birth. A son who was raised in a world quite different from our own. Nevertheless, I was there for the lad. I guided him as best I could. But he's only seventeen, with a mind of his own and judgment that is, well, frankly, not a chip off the old block. There is only one clear solution...  And I think we all know what that is--
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
In a hurry, are we?
My parents? What do you mean?
How you doing, Artie?
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
You mean he withdrew...
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
Maybe she used another name.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
You saw the news today?
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
If you want company...
Where's the body?
No.
Oh, Ray... no...
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... God, what did I do?
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?
Thank you, Jimmy.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Kelly.  What is it?
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
How much?
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.
We have to stick with the plan.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
I can't help it.  He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him?  She's not that way.  I think he did something...
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
Say you love me.
Forget it.
You're not in bad shape, really.  I know you think you are, but you're not.  Let me tell you why.  Sandra Van Ryan.
There's nothing for them to get.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Davy.
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
Yes.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
Did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little Suzie Toller to death with a wine bottle?  Jesus, man. It couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie. I can't talk 'em out of it.  We should be celebrating.  This thing worked out just like you said, only better.
You mean this thing?
I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
Jesus, man... You okay?
What's wrong?
No.
Valet?  You jest of course.  I am a U.S. Marshal.
Just another bureaucratic foul-up. You know how these pencil-pushers are.  So, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
Always hoping.  Or this...
Your little jack-in-the-box gun. That might be useful.
Aha!
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
Well... that, too.
So... what happened?
Oh, damn!  That's it.
What's this?
What is that?
And people are actually fooled by that?
There's only seventy-eight.
It was in your book.
God in heaven, what is that?!
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
You've... done... this... before.
She's perfectly safe.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Your private train, sir.
Would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
Good work.  Really.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
I must compliment you on Miss Thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
I've even printed my own currency.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
I beg your pardon?
Hey...!
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
You left me to die, friend.
You are very important, Willow.
Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
You're a fool.  Now put her back.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Then you get us out of here.
Smells like a battle.
Time to change her diaper.
Where's the baby??
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
You?
She's a bird, Willow.
It's not a Nelwyn baby.
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
What do you want!
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
But what am I gonna transform??
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Ouch!!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
Tir Asleen.
Patience, Willow.
I'm not going in there.
We gotta follow them.
Get back here, Rool!
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Talk!  Say something!
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Who are these orphans, anyway?
I came to see Rachel Lapp.
Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.
Your hole is healed, then?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
Have you got your gun on now?
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
It's all over, Paul.
Where are you taking us?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
But why would they murder...
But why?
Who are they?
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
We had some lemonade and he left.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
You're so sure of that?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Anybody know about this?
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
It's me.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
What's so funny?
Is the English dead?
That has no place in this house.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Get back in there.
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
Oh, come on - come on! We'll soon find the Wizard!
...didn't you?
Oh, please give me back my dog!
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
Oh, now?
Are you ready now?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Oh --
Aw, come, come, come --
That's our farm!
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
We might.
Can't that female take no for an answer?
Oh, he's just ascared again.
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Yes -- let's run!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Supposin' you met an elephant?
...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
...yes.
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Um-hmm.
Um-hmm.
Oil can what?
But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
...along.
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
No -- No -- No -- No!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
What if it were a brontosaurus?
What happened?
Here --   Come on.
They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
And you're going to lead us.
I haven't slept in weeks.
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
...the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
No, her dog!
...junk!
Beautiful!  What an echo!
No, sir!
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Hey, Dorothy!
Did you hear that?  He'll announce us at once!  I've as good as got my brain!
It's a whozis.
They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
...to Dorothy!
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
Well --
How can I ever thank you enough?
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
Stop that dog!
Shame you had to spot I wasnt the real thing.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
What is it?
Zukovsky...
Is there another way?
I love Christmas in Turkey.
...yes?...
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
You havent been given an assignment in this case.
He survived?
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Theyre getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I cant help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty.
Shell get over it.
A word? Im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
I havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I dont want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father.  I loved him.  Im not sure he knew that.
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
What the hell are you doing here?
Since I was a child, Ive always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
Valentin Zukovsky.
You, of course. I need some information.
See?  Youre upsetting my customers. What do you want?
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Really Bond, couldnt you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
I thought you were the one in her business.
No! Bond!
What is this place?
Your people? Your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. You and my father. He didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
Warm.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a call from Washington.
Walter --
Hi, Jon.
Blake?  Dead?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter a bit.  I want you to cure me.
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
Who?
She's with me.
What??
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Damn straight.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
They're following us.
What?
He saved himself.  He changed the past.
Dan -- what do we do now?
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
. . . That was quick.
What new information?
What caused it?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --
Sphinx brand.  When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . . humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco, that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs as you smoke it?  In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Adrian.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Who the hell are you?
Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
Is that all?
Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde...
We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
Go to hell!
What are you?
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
They tell me you're an American agent.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
Are you alright?
Where are we going?
Aren't you afraid?
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Yorgi and Kirill.
You okay?
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
I can see that. Why?
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
Sorry, "dude".
Help me with this guy.
I remember that one where you jump the motorcycle over the freeway at rush hour.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Scott.. I -
He's already losing control of his vitals.  Respiratory.  Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
I've served with men like you before. Methodical.  Systematic -- Naive.  You know what happens to those men in a real fight?
Anything else I can get you?
He takes himself seriously.
Logan, do you see this ring?
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
I do love a good check mate.
He helped you?
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
This checkmate goes to you.  I didn't want to hurt anyone.  But you leave me no choice.
Oh, shit.
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
Call me from New York before you leave??
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Goodbye, darling.
I suppose you're right.
Good night.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
But, sir...
Are these your bags?
There wolf!  There castle!
I thought you wanted to.
Suit yourself...I'm easy.  Better watch out for the wockers.
The wockers with the knockers.
Down!  Get down, you beasts!
Aye-gor!
How?
I want that brain.
Hmm!
That's not bad.
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
You can't win 'em all.
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Repeat it anyway -- it's a wonderful cue.
Where is he?
All right -- where is she?
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Hello there.
Get the sedative ready!
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
What's that tune that you're playing
Extremely well.
Inga, wake up!
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
Right here?
It wasn't me.
Did you do it?
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
What?
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
Ready for Fuchsmachen???
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
Look how far we've come.

Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Splendid site, Crealock, splendil I want to establish Camp here immediately.
Choose your targets men. That's right Watch those markers. 55
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
