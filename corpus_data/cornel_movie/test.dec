Cameron.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Tons
You always been this selfish?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Who?
Is he oily or dry?
Expensive?
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hi, Joey.
Can we go now?
You did what?
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
So did you
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
So they tell me...
How many people go here?
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Yeah -- we'll see.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
You get the girl.
Not at all
Away.
Forget it.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
We don't chat.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I'm fine. I'm
I just need to lie down for awhile
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
You 're so --
Acting the way we do.
How?
Hearsay.
Go to the prom with me
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Yeah...
What?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
We're your guys.
Just for now.
Yeah.
I'm likin' you guys better
See you next week!
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Dr. Ruth?
Absolutely not.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Excellency, you are right.
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No?
I'm not bargaining!
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
... for a commoner?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Look out of that window.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Chief says...
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
So was Christ!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Damn God!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
Give me absolution.
Surely you can do anything you want.
Thank you.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We don't need to know.
My horse doesn't work.
God be with us admiral.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
So...the station is empty?
Yes, I considered it.
I know.
I'll get my clothes.
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
Okay.  But not water sports.
Yeah.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
Nah, why should you?
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
You're Polish?
I'm on duty.
Something back home?
You wanna talk to her alone?
My point exactly.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Alright?
Hey.
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
Could be Leon's.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Don't be late.
I'm not moody.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
That's unique.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
You'll be my first.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Where is escort service?
Yes sir.
Yes.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Don't speak Russian!
We have no money.  Come on.
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
Cut!
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Credit?
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
Milos.  Get my money!
A job?
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
That's what it looks like to me.
No way!  He's mine!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
How long they been livin' here?
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
What's up?
It's possible.
No. I never did, either.
No.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
And don't you worry about it.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
She's in the bathroom.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Thank you.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Well, that does sound very odd.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
Roger.
Opening pod bay doors.
How about chargin' the battery?
Great, just great.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
What are you talkin' about?
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
Luther's on the move...
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Partnership?
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Jack?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I didn't have the time.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
What?
What'd you do?
I guess he got the message...
Hey, you know what I really think?
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Jack?  What was that?
Hiya, kid.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
That's what I always say.
Shut up.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
Not bad, not bad.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
This ain't a credit business.
Napoleon... small.
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
No thank you.
They are robots!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
I brought the girl remember?
So you do know her.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
It means, "Never without my permission".
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
They are... with me...
I was talking to the cat.
Don't exist bud.
We will be ready, Lord.
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
You little sleaze bag!
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
This is a police control action..
Not without Leeloo.
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
Why not?
I thought you were divorced.
Learning language.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
...Hoppi-hoppa.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
...The rain falls...
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Been here long?
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
You don't understand...
I promised him to Machine.
I'll consider it.
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Right here.
Look, I don't know what this...
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I know what you did.
Fuck you!
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Something like that.
Tell me what happened.
What did you do with her body?
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
They're no friends of mine.
You'll get it when we get there.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
I'll risk it.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Good for you.
There's not much illegal.
You're a private eye.  Like Shaft.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Interesting theory.
Twenty-five.
I don't know, where are yours?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
Specialty product.
Where does he sell it?
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
Apparently Mr. Longdale has something he feels he simply must say before you and I speak.
Thank you.
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
I don't understand, who are... ?
Neil... Neil Cole.
No.
Okay.
Who is this... ?
No... no... no...
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
What?
I can't find him.
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Have you seen Joey and Kincaid!  God, I can't find them.  I can't find them anywhere.
Yeah, I'm not so sure.
We have matching luggage.
That obvious, huh?
Extra money, huh?
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Three days.
Is there something we can do?
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
She knew she was gonna die.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
It's okay, Dan
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
You're not taking my baby!
She doesn't want me around
Who said I...wait, what?
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
Goddamn it, Yvonne!  You don't just run away from this guy!  He finds you in your dreams.
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
That's why it's my fault Dan's dead.
Yeah.  I'm just aces.
I don't know!
Then we'll find another way.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
No shit.
Next life.  Oh, what's that?
Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
Stick around, please?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
You may not <u>win</u> them.  But without men like your father, to 'degrade' himself by fighting to preserve them - or as much as we have of them - they'd have disappeared, <u>long</u> ago!
Yes?
'Us?'
Listen!  Hear that?
Somewhere down there?
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
What???
Under <u>water</u>?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
Who with?
Huh?
That's what I said!
Thank you.
The pattern.  Each incident occurred almost precisely a thousand statute miles from the Pole.  A line through the points of occurrence makes almost a complete circle...
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Has anybody offered to buy it?
He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
Yeah. I know about that.
No, not exactly. I'll look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn. Interview your daughter. Jill, right?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
You can't buy Wade off.
That was me.
You think so.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really mean. Me and my pals, me and my brothers. It was kind of funny then. Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. Stuff like that.
What are you talking about?
It's not that.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Yes.
Nothing.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
What are you sorry for?
I want to go home.
Where's the plow?
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Hi honey.
Tonight. Let's get together.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
Good.
Wade.
When did she die?
Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. I'm just --
You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
Nothing.
We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
In the living room.
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Yeah.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
That's what you think.
For what?
Alice...
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
Yes dear?
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Alice... I...
Warn then again. If they don't respond... shoot them down. We will not be intimidated.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Lemme take a look.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
Nine.
Well it worked.
Avionics compartment! It's the only place. You better get Zedeck down there fast Unless, of course, you'd rather be a martyr than a savior.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Copy, Air Force One.
Very good. Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.
Yes
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
You'll do it?
You don't like seeing people get hurt. Now in morality, that is a virtue. In politics, however, that is weakness.  You were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
One thing I've learned as
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
They've gotta be joking.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
Yes, sir.
Rose, I don't have time for this.
She's a big girl.  She understands.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
Please... don't start with me.
Flying the plane.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
We're under attack.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the Speaker say?
Yes, sir.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
How long's it been since you flew, sir?
Dunn.
Who's that, Ted?
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, please be careful.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
Simon.
I'm so excited, Simon.
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Negative.
Go ahead.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Scraps.
Yeah.
You're sure?
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
A b...
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Headquarters!? What is it?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
You promise you'll write.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
I will, but Jim won't.
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Yes?
Of course.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
That's right.
Show me.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Nothing.
Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
How the hell do you know that?
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
Did you learn anything?
Did you talk to him?
My partner is dead!  Because one of you bastards killed him -- then disappeared into a rathole down in Slagtown, where he's home and dry, 'cause nobody sees nothing, nobody says nothing...
Your mother mates out of season.
From quarantine, when my people first arrived here.  He and I were housed together.
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
We mate for life.  Divorce... is a strange concept to us.
I appreciate your honesty, George.
Maybe not... I don't know.  I'm not sure I'm gonna go.  She doesn't need her burn-out of a father there...
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Don't count on me, George.  I never had any ideals.
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
You must leave me alone on this.
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
Do what?!  George-- ?!
... It's Harcourt.
Only holds five.
Well, one of the men didn't like him so much...
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll bet.
It is. 
Of course.  Right in the trunk of the car.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
You'd drifted right through the core systems.  It's blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
Well, I was going to wait until after the inquest...
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
She's right.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
You sent them to that ship.  I just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. Signed Burke, Carter J.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
It's insured.
Thirty-eight...simulated.
Apone...where are your people? Anybody in D-Block?
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Sir?
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
You tell me.  I only work here.
Sure, Hicks.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
The only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  Then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
We ain't going anywhere.
Hudson, give us a break.
Just get back here!
Yeah.  What?
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
How long have I been on Gateway station?
They're dead.
I'm sorry, Newt.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
You mean dead.
I know, honey.  Me too.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Sixty, maybe seventy families.
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Certainly!
Indeed.
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
You might be disappointed.
Extremely clever.
Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in anything. Please, Your Grace, give him one more chance.
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Well, ask her!
Wolfi.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Why?
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
But! I'm a married woman!
What?
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
Adorable!
Gertrude!
Yes. He is a little strange.
Thank you, Madame.  Come on now - courage. Play me something you know.
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
My dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. I think I'm right in saying that, aren't I, Court Composer?
Twenty-six.
What is it?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
I will.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
I will, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Yes what?
In there, sir.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
I'm afraid not.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
I don't know. They say I've got to re-write the opera, but it's perfect as it is. I can't rewrite what's perfect. Can't you talk to him?
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
I think you overestimate our dear Viennese, my friend. Do you know you didn't even give them a good bang at the end of songs so they knew when to clap?
What work?
Who are you?
I mean to come to my opera. You are the only colleague who did.
I have bad fancies. I don't sleep well anymore. Then I drink too much, and think stupid things.
I'm too young to be so sick.
No! No, it's him!
What?
Also identical?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Yes!
What for?
Just let me tell you how it begins.
Yes, but this is not a ballet. This is a dance at Figaro's wedding.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Here in Vienna.
Do you believe it?
God's ways are not yours. And you are not here to question Him. Offer him the salt of penitence. He will give you back the bread of eternal life. He is all merciful. That is all you need to know.
No, Father. From now on no one will be able to speak of Mozart without thinking of me. Whenever they say Mozart with love, they'll have to say Salieri with loathing. And that's my immortality - at last! Our names will  be tied together for eternity - his in fame and mine in infamy. At least it's better than the total oblivion he'd planned for me, your merciful God!
Yes.
Oh. Well, thank you! How wonderful. Some people get all the luck.
No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Yes, I believe he did.
Yes, sir.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
Is David acting strangely?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Yes?
Call me Alex.
Right.
I thought you were asleep.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Will you come with me?
Not just a patient -- me.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Yes?
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
I'm freezing.
No.
No.
No!
Why on earth do you say that?
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
That's very funny, that is.
I was having a nightmare.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
Did you see Jack?
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Yes.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
You ask them.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Yeah?
It's circling us.
Walk away, Jack.
Yeah.
Are you going to help me up?
David!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
Yes.
What do you think?
Hello.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
I beg your pardon?
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
Yes - sure
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Yes, sir.
Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust
The bank. All right. Do anything you want with it.
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
You don't have to do nothing.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
What is?
Please, please don't laugh at me, Phyllis. I must see you tonight!
Don't you know?
Come on up for just a few minutes. We'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
What are you doing here?
Now?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Ah, Mrs. Pembroke. I spoke to Mr. Schaffer at the Guaranty. He's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
Mr. Schaffer will take good care of you. He'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
No, sir.
And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Listen, Matt. If you don't tell the truth, I can't help you. Where were you last night?
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
Matt, come here!
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Yes, sir.
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
Yes.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
That was two hours ago.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
Leave me alone, Bob.
I can hit those boys from here. We just need a distraction.
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
Best damn plan I heard all war.
Two.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
What?
You, ya barrel of pork lard. Here piggy piggy!
I think I recognize you.
Perfect, Cole.
Sorry.
Sure, cousin.
Yep.
That's it.
You'll be smiling once you've got all that money to spend, cousin.  Cole Younger's going to make everybody rich!
A trap.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
You ride like a Comanche.
Where is Jesse James?
On account of we're robbing it.
I'd appreciate that.
So?
Died a hero.
So we got a plan?
You can shut up now.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Damn. All that reading paid off.
What do you think?
Fine. How'd it go out here?
And I do so want to shoot some Pinkerton detectives.
If I could go back to farming --
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
Oh yeah.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
But he killed a lot of men, too.
So what was he?
Yeah Jimmy?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
A river pirate.
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
You planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Where will you find such a girl?
What?
Yes ma'am.
But I like the presidential suite.
Pity.
Last February?
I figured.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
I swear.
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
What is going on here, man?
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
It is a nice piece of writing.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Pumpkin?
Courtney? Dinner?
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Evelyn?
Hi. Pat Bateman.
Everybody's rich.
I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
I'm just leaving.
How did you guess?
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
No, he doesn't.
You saw the ad in the Times?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
But that's simply not possible. And I don't find this funny anymore.
It's just not.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Commes des Garcon.
What?
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Like what?
Ask me a question.
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Can you bring Mr...
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
What's that?
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
Why?
What do you think I do?
No. Flattering, but no.
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
No. I really don't.
Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
Why would I?
Does he do this all the time?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
It's no problem
No, really. I'm okay.
Who do you ask?
What do you mean...Yale thing?
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
Hang...out?
Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
No, he just hung out there.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
And?
I can't...I can't find a shelter
I've been great. And you?
Yeah, well, you're late.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Another Martini, Paul?
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
'Gonna wait outside.
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Milo! What about --?
It was a hate crime.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
I remember.
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
He wasn't acting?
Right... What's that mean again?
My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
No. But you can write your own ticket in the Valley after this. We're gonna bring down Outpost.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Wanna be a part of history?
Is it your dish?
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Well -- you sent for me.
What're you implying.
Were the flags for Teddy?
'Have a look?
I do know. You focus on the big problem. But somewhere down the chain, something breaks down. Something gets destroyed. At first it's upsetting. You feel you've lost control.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
No. Please.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
The Day Care?
A what?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
Gary.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Uh. Not exactly.
Jesus, Teddy.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
She's a programmer?
Damn. 'Have to go back over there.  Be so much easier if we could walk in the front door.
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
Kiss me.
Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
Good luck, Austin.
There's one more thing, Austin.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
Don't try to suck up to me! It's a little late for that. I'm a freak! Look at it, it's been rendered useless.
Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward to working with you, but do me a favor and stop calling me baby. You can address me as Agent Kensington. We have to leave immediately. We've preserved your private jet just as you left it. It's waiting at Heathrow Airport.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
A Chigro?
Sure.
I understand that, Mr. Powers, but let me be perfectly clear with you, perhaps to the point of being insulting. I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you.
I am not.
Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
I'll tell him. By the way, I've decided we should keep our relationship strictly professional.
Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa.
Indeed.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
That's fab, because I love you, too, Vanessa.
Hey, wait a minute--
Here, have a piece of gum.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Dr. Evil?
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.
We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
Hello, Scott. I'm your father, Dr. Evil.  I have a son! I have a son! Everyone, I have a son!  Someday, Scott, this will all be yours.
Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
Show me.
Scott, don't say that...
Great.
Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Well, it's kind of weird.
I don't know. I was thinking, maybe I'd be a vet or something, cause I like animals and stuff.
No, he's really evil.
No need. I'll call again.
... head ...
... power ...
Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
Directed by laser. Bounced by satellite. Quite possible.
After the cold war ...
So am I.
Thank you, Steed.
'Our revels now are ended.'
I'll never marry you.
1922. Why the kippers?
And just what is the game?
Mother?
Yes indeed. I need protection.
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
I meant me.
Any other vices?
Why should they think that?
Did you say formal? I must dress.
Any ideas?
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Always.  Except ...
... when I don't. It comes down to one thing, Mrs. Peel. Trust.
Not for a moment.
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Winning isn't everything.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
You first.
Where are you going?
Have you any place in mind?
Must be. Trubshaw's busy. I'll send Mother ...
You're saying I have no choice.
Who's now vanished.
I fail to see --
How did you guess?
It was you who gave Valentine Peel his security clearance ... you're the mole who betrayed the Ministry.
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of this, why don't you? Careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
She may try to kill you.
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
I feel sure of it.
That's not playing by the rules.
If you say so.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
Bond... James Bond.
Five thousand dollars.
What is this person's story here?
Ooh, be still, my heart.
I'm very happy for you two.
So does Debbie.
She's mine!
Fan out and look for them.
Mr. Thomerson.
Sure have...
Yes, sir, I am.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
It looks awful.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
What's the matter?
Your mother's not dead.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Yeah.
You're so romantic...
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Quiet, Mother.
A real turd.
Any time, Al.
Why?
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Screw that.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Milt?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
What do you mean, it changes?
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Olivier's in that, right?
My gift to you.
So long, Father.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I don't know.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
Who?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
I don't know.
Nah, listen to it. It's a pussy. It'll just steam on us. It won't flash. Go high in the ceiling.
Stevie... I...
Just come down, John. Just --
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
It works.
Yeah? What about Laura --
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Hey! You don't know me --
I'm in heaven, Lt.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
-- I told you to stay next to me!
C'mon, let's crawl home.
This?
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
You're selling dad's boat?
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
Saw what?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
You look great.
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Really? No kidding.
Hey, sorry if I made you look bad in front of your boss. But I'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, I'm trying to do something here. There's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. Tell Swayzak to talk to one of them.
Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in...
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
You could check. It'd be in his files.
What?
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
Your Dennis' kid.  I work alone.
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
What?
I'm finished with Swayzak. I'll do whatever you want me to do. I just want to help catch the guy that burned Tim. You gotta give me another shot.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
Yeah? Airtight?
I hate hospitals. You're so... so goddamn useless...
Yeah.
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
Nice boat.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
Hey, what's with the mouth? Where'd you grow up, a barn?
Cute.
-- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
I'll be there, goddamn it!
He's going to be a fireman.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
The great communicator.
He's out.
Y'know, I treated him better than any other probie I ever had. He probably hates my guts, but I did the best thing for him. I made him finally look in the mirror.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
You like everybody, Ronald.
I know you.
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
What do you listen to, Stephen?
Investigator Rimgale.
"Don?"
Just catch the son of a bitch.
Didya ever think of moving to a cheaper apartment? $3,500 a month is crazy, man!
You mean you could use it.
I'm a Catholic.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
All right. What are you gonna do?
How about 7 1/2?
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
What case?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Ho!
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Who are you revolting against?
Delacroix.
And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
What do I do?
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
She's also moorish.
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Look at my lips.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Y'know what I mean.  Got a gig yet for Manray and I yet?
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I would prefer you not use that word in my presence.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I've never been given a fair shot.
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire.
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen.
If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.
Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
It's me, Peerless.
Pleased to meet you.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
Always keep 'em laughing.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
Your father is proud of you.
Do you know how you will use him?
What do you want me to say?
The pleasure is mine.
Everybody shut up.
Please don't go there.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
David, I appreciate your comments. Anybody got an ideas?  Everybody just talk out loud.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
I feel fine.
Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
It looks delicious.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
He said that?
Not at all?
What's a Negro.
Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
I'm sure that was the only thing he was impressed with.  You look beautiful like that.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
The one with da big...
So when are you comin' to pick us up?
...like grits and butter...
Enough.
No, before my time.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
My people love me.
You look beautiful like that.
Good morning.
What is your uncle's name?
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
Your cousins go out with him.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Certain?
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Have you had one?
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
Agreed.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
Yes!
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Good night, my little darling.
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Tender Hegenheim.
Who?
None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us -- which is it?
Can anybody hear me!
We found him like this --
Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
Tell me about them.
You saw West's body.
Jesus!
And the bodies?
No, did he tell you about it? About the business Childs ran?
Sir, yes, sir!
West... he's dead.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
Yeah...
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
From up close or far away?
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
But you didn't.
Stop.
Well?
I didn't do anything --
Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
What the hell are you talking about --
What are you talking about?
That's preposterous --
I wanted to see if he was okay --
Fantastic. You want to tell me what's going on?
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
That is the most unprofessional --
Best time for banal chit-chat.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
I lied. Wait for it...
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
They got their stories straight.
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
You couldn't have known --
You mean the falsely accused?
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Good, just making sure.
Want company?
Poor fucker my ass...
Wrong answer --
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
What the fuck are you doing?
Bullshit --
Shut up!
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
I called the JAG Corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to D.C. on a transport leaving here at 1700 --
No --
It's too neat.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
It truly is.
Why?
No one's ever left.
I brought it.
My father and I have an advantage. We never talk.
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
I know.
Lucky girl.
I never knew.
I like your stories.
Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do want you to leave, Karl. But I want to leave with you.  You think this town is too small for you, well, it's too small for a man of my ambition. I can't see staying here a day longer.
Okay.
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
So how does it happen?
What did he say?
Really.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You mean, while I'm here.
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Oh, so you know.
I think someone hasn't.
Dad?
What?
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
Don't need to apologize to me. I mean, I'm the luckiest person you're going to find today...
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
There is no softer ground than town.
Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
Hello.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
Because he's dying.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
I'll help you.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You don't have to.
They met at Auburn.
Mmm, what?
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Yes.
Yes. But that's a different...
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
What for?
No I don't.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
Thank you.
No I haven't.
I'm asking what you're here for.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Yes.
What's wrong?
It's makes it easier. Okay.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
So you're just going to be vindictive
No. But you tend to tie them up.
You don't want to talk about it.
And. It's wrong.
Sometimes neither.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You don't understand you either.
Get out
Please, there's no... Oh.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
Well what have you got?
No.
She's dead.
Laugh it up.
I'm trying to quit.
Whatever.
I'm sorry.
Tell me about it.
Cash.
Yeah, I know.
Oh! Gave me a start.
Oh, she older than that.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Hey.
Some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. So now they have scented creams. They help moisturize a woman's skin.  This one's my favorite. It's called Ginger Souffle. I recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. So... perhaps just after a shower.
Sure.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Yeah.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
Let go...
LAZ, I said let...!
Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
You sayin' you'll do what?
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
Put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. That's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. She'd fear ya then. Cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. She with a real man now. A real KILLER!
Come on, gal...
Why you got me chained?
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Or what?
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
You drink whiskey?
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
What I love.
Maybe I won't.
Why you say that?
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Or what?
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
One thing at a time, Laz.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
Why she got a chain on her?
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Rae!
Yeah?
Holy shit!
I just like dressin' up in these goddamn blue vests.  Your money ticket get shipped today?
I'm workin' here, Rae. Can you see that?
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Only thing I'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what I should'a done.
What we just did, you askin' for money, make a man stop. I ain't callin' you no ho. But I ain't gonna be played like no trick, neither. Remember... you called me.
The hell you call me?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
-- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
No.
I didn't know.
Hey, when in Rome --
I hope not.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Connie...
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
What's the problem here?
Give us a break...
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
There she is!
You were too far behind.
San is an honorable title.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
Now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
Yes...
We can't lose.
I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
Who am I supposed to be?
Why would you care?
I'm taking you back.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Then take it from him.
What?
You're foreigners.
Twenty-four hours, detective.
I have to get to Sugai.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
I'll pay you.
Swiss bank deposit.  Gold bullion. Whatever you want.  You know the city and the police.
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
Not to be trapped.
Here's your check, my boy.  Thank you.
Nexus - 6.
Like what?
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
Dr. Tyrell?
Thank you.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Your customer, eh?
Day after tomorrow.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
Do you have something against science?
And what in your estimation works?
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
No.  I got a problem.
Huh huh.
Never been more sure of anything in my life.
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
I don't know nothing about it.
You mean the snake.
Sorry.
I bet I would.
Of course not.
It would be my child.
I think you need more help than you've got.
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
Dead.
Not too good.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
I don't like the noise.  Just practice.  Practice makes perfect.
What's a long time?
What difference will it make?
What?
Yes.
Go ahead.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
I'm tired of this.
Of course.
I never seen a turtle.
What's your problem?
Is that why you're still here?
Thank-Q!
How do you do?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Oh, brother...
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
You're lost?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Yes, I'm right?
You don't?
Get away from me!!
I haven't brushed yet.
No.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
Doing what?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
Sure.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Sure.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
Is this your house?
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Yeah.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Not that one!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Eve, I'm sorry.
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
Is that what you call it?
It was at least as good as the sky.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
Yes.
Tempus fugit!
Why?
Your mom made that all by herself.
Merci!
Yes, father?! Yes?
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
And it's called...?
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
Almost all of them.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Goodbye.
My father is a genius.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Just look!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll be all right.
I just hope this is still good up there.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Are you in trouble, son?!
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
I never know anymore.
Yes.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
All our friends...
I'm not hungry.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
I told you! I've got everything!
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
We do?
Well, I am the head of this household--
Some time.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I knew you'd like him.
What's that supposed to mean?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
To bed.
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
Yes, you do!
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Come on.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Roger, Wolf One.
I'm not sick.
Okay honey.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Yes?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
Yeah.
Yes sir. I sure am.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
Yes.
No.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Yes, I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
No.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I sure don't hate you.
Sure I do.
I'm doing it.
What do you want?
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Frank would open you.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I did. Are you?
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
Who, Dorothy?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
Oh he forced you, huh?
My bourbon.
Mommy's here.
You want to see him too, right?
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
FUCK THAT SHIT. PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
There ya go.
Alright.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Yeah, I know.
That sounds great!
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I'll get a coat for her.
Uh-uh.
Am I bothering you?
Yes.
Terrible boring.
That's too bad.
Maybe so.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building? Come on, I'll show you.
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Yeah.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
Okay, okay. Bye.
That's what I thought.
You better not, Jeffrey.
I'm really sorry.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
What is it?
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
You look beautiful.
Really. You want to dance with someone else?
Okay.
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Stop it Mike.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
The Duke?  What did you do?
I can't find the second one, sir.
Got it.
Where's your gun?
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
What happened?
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
I know what the fuck he looks like!
Connor, is that you?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Well, there's my boys.  Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused a ruckus with that shot. Half the damn neighborhood is comin'.
We... met them last night.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Be careful.
Right.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
What?
Little girls catchin' stray bullets in their heads, playin' hopscotch in their front yards. And everyone thinks the same thing... Someone should just go kill those motherfuckers.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
It is your corrupt we claim.
Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. Just relax.
Can she I.D. them?
How do you figure?
It was... It was...
Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.
Why was I not informed of this?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Oh that's just BEAUTIFUL! All the scumbags in the quiet city of Boston start dropping dead and you think it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I want the Boston Police doing my thinking for me, I will have a fucking tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad car and get me over there. I want the crime scene photos and any witness statements. NOW!
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I...
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Hey Murph.
You sure you killed them?
Y'know it is, a bit.
Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was aiming at you!
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Just go!
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Would they do that?
She's an attractive older woman.
Yeah, I saw it.
Eight dollars.
Nothing. Go ahead.
I keep it for emergencies.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
No. We didn't.
Hi.
If you say so.
No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
OK.
He seems pretty good.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
Did that hurt?
Yes. I do.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
Take your second position.
I don't know.
Come on, Kumar.
I'll see you there.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Pretty much everything.
Oh, I'd say about --
It's called a racquet, Anthony, and you're holding it wrong. That's ghetto play. Hold it like this.
Thanks.
I don't think you're giving him enough credit. I know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. He gets too excited. But --
Hold it.
Take a deep breath.
It feels good.
Me?
Why'd you want to help us?
I don't know. Sure, I guess.
Let them fight.
I hope not.
I'm not playing any more golf.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
Jesus Christ! No.
Sure.
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
I didn't do anything.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
What's he doing here?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
It's true, Dignan.
I'll just drive my car.
I told you he's crazy.
No, I was saying crazy like a lunatic.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
Don't count it.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I don't know.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Man, I don't want to go into this.
Look. We want you on the job.
I know it, man. Hang on.
What's that?
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
26 weeks.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
Well, I left some money in there.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
You Hoto?
There was a mistake.
Will it track back to us?
And the Landy woman?
What do you mean?
Do you know what his budget was?
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
I'm sorry, Ward.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
'Why' would be enough for me.
It was staged?
Jesus...
I speak English.
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
No, I do.
What?
Yes...
YOU'RE A LIAR!
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I should be better by now.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
-- where? -
-- not yet --
There must be another way!
Who is Pamela Landy?
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
No. You never worked Berlin.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Careful...
What's that?
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
But we can relax. We tracked him. He's on a train to Moscow.
What? The tapes?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
You mean, did I want a date?
So?
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
It was in Latin, sir.
It is suicide.
So let the council swear publicly.
My father hears that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.
Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent riders to speed any word.
You mock us with a smile?
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
Before he lost his powers of speech, he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.
I rest.
Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
No. One of us is enough.
Armed?
You win.
That depends on the man.
A common thief.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
This is what happens when you must send a woman. And a fool.
My greatness is better demonstrated with this.
I... accept your proposal!
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
And I with you. But you must wake.
How do you know this?
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
I am trying.
The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
Of course. There is one more thing, Mrs. Treborn. And I feel bad for mentioning it...
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
Can't he come out for one day?
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
Cute, Evan.
Fix?
Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Can you protect me?
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
I thought you were a December baby.
That's probably why Hannibal Lecter's so smart.
What the fuck are you doing?
Huh?
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
So let's go. This place creeps me out.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
I'm sorry.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
I've stopped a hundred times.
Of course.
It was a long time ago.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Like how?
What?
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
I get it. You can drop it now.
Yeah?
Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
That's right, Evan, and you get to be the star.
It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
Been there, done that.
Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
Maybe because they never do.  So Don Juan, you pass out on all your dates?
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
I came with Captain Renault.
No.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
I thought so. Where's your husband?
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
Yes, Monsieur.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
How long can I afford to stay closed?
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
Er, my check, please.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
And the other alternative?
He hasn't played it in a long time.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
And I was wondering.
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Uh huh.
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
It doesn't matter.
No.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Goodnight.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Apparently he has the letters.
Sam?
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
Thank you. I try.
Any time.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Go ahead.
What of it?
Yes, rather.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Yes, I get the point.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Here it is.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
I slept very well.
Thank you.
Yes.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Perhaps.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
I see what you mean.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Huh!
I stick my neck out for nobody.
Victor Laszlo?
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Yeah? Why?
Put it down as a gesture to love.
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
Oh, thanks.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
There seems to be no secret about that.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
For how long?
No.
No.
Then don't have a drink.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
You've had today's water.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
They're on autopilot.
Shut up.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Do you...have any more packages to deliver?
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Not if you work for FedEx.
You don't seem too happy about it.
Could you watch Jango?
Hey...hey...it's okay!
I thought you might have.
I know.
Is that Jango?
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
It means a lot...that you came.
You too.
And how was your Christmas?
Let's eat.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Can you find her?
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
Stan, it's Chuck...Chuck Noland...
What?
Deep, real deep.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
You cook very well!
I doubt it. She's just an...
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Burma!
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
Sure... I'll see you around.
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
It will be okay.
Nothing.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
What do you want me to *do*?
Please don't...
Sure. Thanks.
I never said they were boring.
Nobody's asked for me, have they?
He's leaving...
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
She looks after other people's children.
No. She was an immigrant.
His father's dead, right?
Is that soon?
A B-24 Liberator.
Have you enlisted?
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
What about the trees?
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
In other words, scurvy.
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
We heard that one already, Homer.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
Why was he missing for twenty days?
They ain't drops--I picked 'em off the tree!
Who *live* here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain *live* here... just breathin' in the vinegar?  Somebody who *don't* live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for *us*. *We* the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our *own* rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
She's about the most beautiful girl I ever seen--I don't know if she's the nicest.
Tough day?
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
I envy you guys. Taking a chance like that.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
I was doing it for them.
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
People have tried this before, Jake. It's never worked. Teddy Fraiser and his crew went on vacation in Chicago for it. Last year, Mumps got pinched in L.A.
So far, masters of our own demise. What bank are you with?
Let's go, Jake?
How's that? He works for Gillette.
No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
Here's what's going to happen. Gordo, we need to find a guy in Gillette's bank. Miles, we need papers, corporate, insurance...
She's up for it.
You sure?
You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
I can't do that.
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
No thanks. I'm good.
I think I just broke my hand.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Sure.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
You interested in a little work?
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Don't worry about it.
What?
Why?
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
Uh-huh.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
WHAT?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
Wait a second... Who's the mope?
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Where the hell is she?
Escorts!
My fucking heart bleeds.
What?
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
Can't do it Suits. I can't lay down for this one.
We got a good thing going here. You want to blow it over an overbite?
A Fed? Is he close?
I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
We're here.
I've been looking for this Jake Vig for some time now. Problem is, the guy's the invisible man. A spook, a spectre, a ghost. Then, like a gift, Jake's good buddy and member of his crew, Alfonse Moorely, is found the other day with a hole in his head.
What do you get out of it?
Roger that.
It's cosmetic. They don't cover cosmetic. Last year I had a tooth capped. The dentist tells me I'm not covered for caps. It's cosmetic.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
Maybe another time.
Seven-fifty.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
I'm working on that soccer story.
Habib?
South African women are very sporty.
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Not particularly.
She had to leave early. She asked me to thank you.
Not entirely.
I. sold the car.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
I've got something to tell you.
I've got a job.
You've got such beautiful hands.
Fine.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
I hope it brings you luck.
You were talking in your sleep.
Leave me alone, Marion.
I hate public transport.
Well, thank you anyway.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
I'll watch.
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
You choose.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
Who's they?
Yes.
Jack! It's Jani.
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Have I?
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
You're talking about complicity.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
That bitch? No.
No.
I was at Beadles.
Five.
What for?
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Very impressive.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
I can see.
Bruised.
Oh. What's wrong now?
Key?
We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Yoo hoo, bomb...
Time to start talking.
All right, then...
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Energy shielding positive function.
Check at six minutes.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Armed.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Hey, bomb.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Right!
To explode, of course.
That is correct.
Of course not.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
Oh, sure.
You know, Doollttle, if we're going into the Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Ah... pity, pity...
Doolittle, hello?
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
Or we could go another way 'cause your boss seems to like my face just the way it is.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
What're you talkin' about?
None of your business.
You mean until you showed up?
Police drone.
Don't look down.
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
I ain't mad at you...
I don't get involved with guns.
It's a rule.
I got overhead...
Every week.
SHHH!  Don't do that!
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
We're just a little tense right now...  It's okay.
We didn't get a chance to finish our conversation the other night.
Wasn't that hard.
Lauren's not my wife.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
Something.
Yeah...
Yes on all counts.
You did go through my stuff.
He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
How much do you know?
A girl.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
Somebody's got to.
My mother used to say the universe is right on schedule.  Everything happens like it's supposed to.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
Any idea when she'll be back?
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
You're also a fool.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
Let go of my hand.
I understand.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
I'll live... Regarding your case...I'm afraid I've come up with some bad news on your fiance.  Lemme get the file.
Bastard...
You and me both.
Straight.
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
You know what I'm saying.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Where?
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
I have sincere eyes.
I know what I got, Max.  They put me back on that drug they're giving the other vets.  Only the guy does those cable hacks says the stuff's no good.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
We gotta talk.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
But there's another side--
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
Even if she doesn't dump me, which is unlikely, she'd never be able to trust me again.
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
You don't.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
I was on call. 
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
I'm not paying you for the lovemaking, Hawk. I just want you to have whatever you needed the money for when you took me up on my offer.
Hawk.
Got any KISS?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
It's okay.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! We find four really small kids, beat the shit outta them and steal their tickets. What do you think?
Check!
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
Then lighten up. She'll never know we touched it. Alright, here's the plan. We bus it to chez Lex, grab the Volvo, bail Jam the hell outta St. Bernard's and arrive at the train station precisely on time for the 2:45 to Detroit.
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Wait a minute. We ditching the rest of school?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
The paint!
Now there's a woman who totally abuses the privilege of motherhood.
Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
Nah. Couldn't be.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Uh-uh. Don't tell us, Jam. Just show us.
See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
NOW!
Just keep your lying, heathenous trap shut, Jeremiah.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
It's not nearly enough, punk.
Not if I shoot first!
Good morning...
Horrible accident. My neighbour... he got killed.
He got smooshed. By a jet engine.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Donnie! Give it back!
You'll know soon enough.
I am so sorry.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
You should already know that.  Watch the movie, Donnie. I have something to show you.
A hundred and one, I think. Every day she does the same thing. But there's never any mail.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Why?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Where is she?
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Yeah...
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
We will not have this kind of language at the dinner table.
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
You know, Roberta Sparrow. We almost hit her with the car the other day.
A lot of people. Teachers. Younger kids. It's like they're afraid of me for some reason.  But that's OK... because I know I deserve it.
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
I met a girl.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
I know.
I... I was playing with fire.
You will survive this... Donald. I promise you that you will survive. You must let me help you.  And when I clap my hands together, you will wake up.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Maybe you'd like to tell Mom and Dad why you stopped taking your medication.
I was just being honest.
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
Donnie? You're a dick.
Don't worry, Mom. Just go, you'll miss your flight.
What else?
Rose, I'll tell you this because our daughters have been on dance team together for two years and I respect you as a WOMAN. But after witnessing your son's behaviour today, I have... significant doubts...  Our paths through life must be righteous. I urge you to go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son does not succumb to the path of fear.
Kitty...
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
Raspberry.
No more fuckin' for her.
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
No. Mom said if I did, she'd look up my dad and marry him.
Loretta, never have kids.
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Your parents'd kill you.
Yah?
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
No. Loretta called. There's been a... a fire.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
It's me... I just don't want this to be the thing you'd do over. This pageant's your ticket outta here. I know you can win, Amber.
Oh my God! My -- my tap costume's gone.
Well, as my mother says at Sunday dinner, "Come and get it," bitch!
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
Then it must be Wednesday.
Bye.
Loretta, shut it.
Okay. Take her purse.
She's the winner and we're going to state.
My dress'll reek.
That's right.
Yeah.
Ohio...
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
Tammy Curry?
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
We need more bars!
Enid ate a whole pan!
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Come on! Hankey here can't help it if he was born crazier than a shithouse rat!
The king can do no wrong! 
"My"...
About - thirty-four seconds.
None of your business...  Take another letter.
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
She did.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
We gotta two battalions and one Frenchman.
I've gotta five thousand men but no horses.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
You couldn't hang me in your bedroom -- I'll make a note of it.  Where's my secretary? 
Carry out this tragic folly if you will -- But I for one will not be a part of it.  I will stay here in Freedonia.
Go ahead.
Yes.
Bah!! 
Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
No... it was a seven letter word.
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
WHAT  ?
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
Well, these things take time.
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
What is it?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation.
Indeed!
Yes sir.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
...Yes, Sir.
Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. I just felt that I had to do anything I could to protect him.
Yes, I think I can.
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
I feel much better. Thank you.
I am very pleased to meet you.
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is "like me".
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so... I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
Oh no?
You're English.
Yes.
Oh no, my friend...
Yes.
Thank you... very much.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
My name is...
Righteousness...
Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
I'm not used to such kindness. From a beautiful woman.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Never, oh! Never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats Nothing will die.
Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
John.... how can you ever forgive me?
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Welcome home, John.
When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
I don't know how you do it, Aud... I sometimes think you've got some of your mother's magic...
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
You mean... you HAVE got into bed with somebody else?
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Why?
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
That's right!
Of course.
I... but I...
The second note to wake the Gods...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
I shouldn't have come.
I see the world.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
I'm sure it's lovely.
You've got to let me go!
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
You don't love ME.
Well... no...
He was lucky...  Sit there.
Very deep... usually...
No.
I know. I know.
She got me thinking...
That's my boy!
Sorry!
Now stop it!
What is it?
What are you talking about?
I will join my grandfather there.
I was sitting there.
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
The Dragon...
What do we have to do?
I thought I might do a bit of business on the way.
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
No, I'm not.
Olaf Tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
Bastard.
That's it!
That's it! AND you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
I... I...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
What have you got there?
Yes, it is good. But I told him ten.
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
That's right.
Help!
Like you got rid of Snorri!
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
DEATH TO DRAGONS!
Sh!
Dad!
No... he's not... not... there...
Yes, Mum.
I never do...
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
Say hi to Naomi.
I did. You said, things were fine.
I told you that later.
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Yeah, I got it.
I'm Joel.
Well, anyway... Sorry.
Yes?
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Sort of, um...
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
Very much.
I'm fine.
You pick it.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
No.
No, not at all.
Oh, yeah.
That's scary sounding.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
You didn't say anything about my hair.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
You're not ready.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
No, it isn't that.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
Yeah.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
But you weren't. I could tell.
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
Not yet. Not married.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
Oh.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Tomorrow?
Make love?
Well, you obviously don't know me.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
Guess what I'm wearing.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Long day thinking.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
I wasn't going to call her. Not after the way she was.
Well... I did.
You have to stop this!
Go back to sleep.
Yeah. Cool.
Very cool. Trippy.
Hi.
I know. Anyway --
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Thanks, Stan.
Nothing.
How do you mean?
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Just wanted to let you know.
She likes you okay.
This one's history. Moving on...
Jesus, Patrick!
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
I know who you are.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
I'm staying with the Countess.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Like what?
Well.... er...
What guy?
I have to go, Julian.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
I was a successful model once.
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
Bonanza Jellybean?
Your ranch?
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
I don't know anything about it.
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
Don't start with me, Cooper.
EVERYBODY SHUT UP! Let the man speak.
You've had plenty EVA, Coop, it's Justin's turn. Stay on station. If anything happens...
Hold on, Coop...
On my way.
You prep the gravity couches. I'm going to manually arm those explosives.
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
No, he didn't.
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
I don't need sleep, DJ. I need answers.
No.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
"Save yourself. From Hell."  What are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
A written briefing can't possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. I have to go with them.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Almost done, I just gotta check one thing...
Justin.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
I don't know, this place is really dark, I can't see a thing...
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
Negative.
"Insane?" The finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. It would take the Lewis and Clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. The Event Horizon could be there in a day...
If it worked, yes.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
I don't know.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
Yes...
Bring us in tight. Starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
Where is it?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
Let's go.
Come around to three-three-four...
We're all here.
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
What's going on in there, Starck?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Five seconds.
Not according to the computer.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
It's cold.
Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point A" here...  ...to "point B," here.  Now: what's the shortest distance between two points?
Dead ahead, 5000 meters.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
How?
If they were in stasis, I'd get a location, but these readings, they're all over the ship. It doesn't make any sense.
Ship's log.
It means nothing.
Relax, it's casual.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Victor did.
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
Oh, he did.
It's easy for you to be patient.
To help you. I've run every test known to man. And they all yield the same result: the machine is ready.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I think I need to lie down. Bad shrimp.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
Go back to the drawing board.
The Center for Disease Control. If this thing is contagious --
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Ben, are you there?
You've been working out.
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
What are you trying to say? Just because I dress well and like to dance --
Oh, well that's easy: I'm hot. You're... well, you're a little limp. Sue's easy to see through. And Ben's always been a hardass.  Why aren't you writing this down?
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
That's the temperature of the sun.
You gave us names? What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Blockhead started it!
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Never better.
I was talking about us. Working together.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
We need to get past them.
Are you kidding?
And reverse the mutations --
Of course. Of course.
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
You need a doctor.
Not at all.
Get a grip. Reed. We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch. Just close the shields...
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Ben did this.
I understand the business reasons.
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
It is. There's something we need to talk about. Something I need to ask you...
Susan. What are you doing?
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Later.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
Why can't you do it?
Don't strain yourself.
They're not home yet.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
I didn't say that.
See you later.
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Yes, sir.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Sure. Come on in.
Come on...
So are you.  Are you shaking?
I know it's yours.
We've got to get an abortion?
You should work for yourself.
Really?
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
I hear they all dress like that at Lincoln now.
All right. Pay attention.
Damone! You come here?
Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with Stacy. What have you got to prove?
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
Yes.
And they don't call my parents?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Totally.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Do you think that guy's cute?
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
There's nothing to it.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Not since November.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Aloha, Spicoli.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
My other question is... can-I-have your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you out-sometime?
Oh yeah.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
I'd like that.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
Dobermans don't talk.
Naw! Not a major.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
Indeed. We must do it. What kind of story is this?
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators.
But what about our room? And the golf shoes?
Why what?
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Not much. Why?
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Don't touch it! Get back in that tub!
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
Plans?
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
I could already feel the stuff working on me -- the first wave felt like a combination of mescaline and methedrine -- maybe I should take a swim, I thought...
Right!
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
Never missed a plane yet.
Nobody. I'm the maid!
You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
I don't know what you're talking about!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
But it's got teeth.
Gonna stay for a couple?
Hey. You noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Easy.
The door... on three.
What?
We lived near power lines.
What?
Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
What?
He only shot you once.
The boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. Nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
Two.
Holds four.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
Amazing you made it this far.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Not without you!!!
Stop her!
I'd love to.
I'm not lying.
Putting on my armor.
I think it's time to take the gloves off.  Get me some reporters.  Particularly Louella Parsons!
Thank you --
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
I know, but --
In my eyes, officer.
Who?
All square, Doc.
I know you believe that.
Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
We'll get you home, Frances.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
No. Never.
See you next weekend, Dad.
I didn't have much to do with it.
Francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.
You really want to go?
And you think it's worth all this?
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Please, Francie...
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
Oh Angela, my own... Angela!
You can always come see it in London.
Are you an actor?
Are you really serious? About acting?
Then don't go to Hollywood.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
They'll mend.
Not me. But other people seem to.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Harry.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
They killed him. They threw him out that window.
I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
Forget it.
Think I'll have a glass.
Huh?
I guess.
Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double for me!
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
I'm not sure.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
I'm preparin' it for the next tenant, he's coming in tomorrow.
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
You got it.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Then why did you bring them?
Go on...
What's wrong?
Where are you going?
Sure.
Yes, Mama.
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
I see.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
Then why weep for him?
You speak.
How did you find me?
Kill me and have done with it.
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
How dare you. You're disgusting and evil.
Materials. Nothing more.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
There is something I want.  A friend.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
SHE'LL NEVER BE YOURS! SHE SAID MY NAME! SHE REMEMBERS!
Fine.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Your decision. For us.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
Now husband and wife.
As a march hare.
You're a comfort to me, Henry.
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
Things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. Thousand new cases a day now. Classes have been suspended. University's shut down.
Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
No. They don't.
Thank you, Henry.
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Victor, explain yourself.
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
I'm... dying.
Are you a physician?
You know of it?
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
No, no, they're all dead...
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
I walked into it knowing I'd get hurt, but I thought I could stand anything.  I just wasn't ready for that kind of pain. We were supposed to meet in L.A. When I got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
I don't know.
Absolutely.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Here we go.
Don't get up. Take a second...
Get behind him more.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
God, but I love that macho talk! Emergency generators! The Indian used campfires.
Good call.
I don't love Neddy.
Rocky Road.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
You've made a science out of coincidence.
Just my son and I.
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
I have no idea.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
Thank you, son.
Jacob.
What's this about, money?
Come again?
Sorry, I need everybody.
Yes, she is.
Yes, they do.
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
Yes.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
Forever together.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
Yep.
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
No.
Feels good.
Cops.
How do you know?
What?
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
What?
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
What?
That's what you look like.
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
He needs our help!
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
What'd you find, Kathy?
Thank you, sir.
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
You makin' friends with the press, lieutenant?
I'm not sure what --
Sir?  What did he say?
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Yes, dear.
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
What changed?
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
Doesn't matter who she picks.  No woman is going to last one week in a commando training course.  And I don't care who it is.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
I can make this wall without --
Sir?
Signals received only sparingly, in such a pattern that leads us to conclude it is a downed aviator trying to conserve his batteries.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
I take it you don't either.  Feet.
This has nothing to do with you.
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who?
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
I don't know, I don't care.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Thanks, Wick.
That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why.
Sure, sure.
I don't know...
Educate her, Pyro.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
I think you're the liar.
No.
North?
Sure.  Now she wants to shoot.
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Only one way to find out.
No.
You must have quite some harem.
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
I don't think so.
Where's Luc and Pierre?
You're fast.
It's Tatopoulos.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
We know.
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
You're standing on it.
You see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Sounds like a big company.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
So you're in?
Makes us look more American.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Don't do that. I'm not kidding.
Yes sir. Marvelous, isn't it? Completely distractionless.
I'm... I'm shot.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
Friend. You stole all my best lines.  You cut me out of episode two entirely!..
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
I had the shot...
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
Shut up.
The guy is terminally selfish!
You could order something in.
I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
All this from watching the.. historical records?
Alex? Where are you going?
Nobody was WATCHING?
What?
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
It's a television show. Okay? That's all. It's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
What's  your name, son?
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
Okay, that's where you want to be.
Lt. Madison, GO.
GO Commander.
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
We're getting major structural damage.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Of course... We'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
The lost footage. At the convention. The mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
Hey. Thanks for one nice intro... uh.
Hey, YOU want to drive?
Where'd they go? Back inside?
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
Computer, can it be repaired?
Computer, do we have a replacement Beryllium sphere onboard?
Don't be ridiculous.
Nothing. Hold please.
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Closer?  I can try.
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
Simpler.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
Well... Sort of...
But...Why?
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
It's as far as it goes!
What kind of signal?
Okay, let's go.
How about the pig-lizard?
It doesn't have eyes.
We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Pedal to the metal...
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
What does she see in them?
Patience, Colonel Arnold.  Active personalities terrify these men.  But, congratulations on your victory at Ticonderoga...
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
Christ, George, Joseph Reed's been writing letters back to Congress attacking you.  Your own aide!
That can't be.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
Get the body of our army up to Greene's vanguard as fast as we can.  All the damned fool has to do is hit the British rearguard and then hold for us.
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
I'm not sure.
But it's more than just that, am I right?
I don't know:  delivering men and delivering men with their goodwill are two different things.  And, if he's popular with his men...
I think many would like to see him commander-in-chief.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
I hear General Lee is holding seven thousand fresh infantry back in New York -- why won't he come on!?
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
I... they look both the same.
Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
I rode here, on my horse.
I will continue with our French allies, concentrating on New York.
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
My God, what?
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
We're leaving them?
I have commanded the Rhode Island Militia for a year now.  My father is an ironmaster.  As was I.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
You've got to stop them here or our whole line will cave-in!  It's all right boys, I'm here!
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
George, I'm sorry.
Sally, our slave system is a British law...
It's stupid, of course.
That's good... who?
That land belongs to the strongest.
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Mr. Lovejoy? That's cute, Bo.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
I was thinking tonight you could go have a look around Palmer's hotel room while I go check out Karen Flores' place. See if he hasn't stashed it somewhere.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
I have to ask you for that key.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
I went to UC San Diego.  We're gonna spend the weekend at the Universal Sheraton. We're gonna take the tour. See the shark. Check out the Miami Vice Action Spectacular. After, we'll come here, get our money.
Yeah, we're getting Martin.
Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
What about her?
Gimme an hour.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
You're gonna just give me five hundred grand?
What I been wondering is where's he been.
That's correct. Look at me.
'Cause the guy's a customer now, stupid. His ass belongs to me.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Leo spanked a waitress?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
Harry, lemme give you some advice.
Fuckin' basketball game.
You just did.
Or the guy thinks he could get 'em broken. You have to understand the loan shark's in business the same as anybody else. He isn't in it to hurt people. He's in it to make money.
That's right. As a matter of fact...
But you work for the casino?
Maybe a few times I have.
Once.
Who's the star?
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
You're kidding, right?
Get the fuck outta my chair.
I found him.
Who?
Who the fuck is Momo? Jesus, these fucking names...
Hey, Bones, looks like you're gonna have a nice scar up there. Maybe these guys can fit you with a rug, cover it up for ya.
He died.
Personally?
What Get Away jet?
A few weeks before shooting, I went back to Bensonhurst, just to listen to you guys. See, I'm Italian, but I grew up in Tarzana. So I wanted to pick up your rhythms of speech.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
I believe it.
I'm up twelve grand today.
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
You broke in?
What if it was?
I know what a vig is.
How much is the wife offered?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
For any movie.
Man, can you scream.
Don't go out of your way.
Sounds fair.
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
You thought I was faking?
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
What happened?
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
I'm thinking about producing.
Pick 'n' Save.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Yeah, lovely. Last night I watched two guys carjack a Camaro down on the corner of Argyle there.  What do you want, Doris?
Murray's dead.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
You don't? What happened to Muff?
That's where you got the idea?
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Oh, yeah, sure.
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
'We?'
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey -  This your ride, Chili?
Thanks.
Roger, Arctic Warrior. I say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea. Over.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things.
That's what it says.
Morning, skipper.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
It's a beautiful country. Very clean. Very civilized. And cold.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
Why not.
What?
Roger?
Or uninvited guests.
I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody.
Gimme a break.
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
Then what the hell happened to him?
Right. Wednesday.
What is it?
Hard to say.
Man, it gives me the creeps. We got no business towing a ship that size anyway. I say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
She take a radio?
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
It looks like it.
What is it?
Not me.
If they knew what they were carrying.
I don't know what you're talking about?
Don't lie to me!
Right.
Because of the gold.
It's my pen name.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
There's somebody else on this boat.
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
Yup.
But where's the damage?
Showing you what?
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
That much I think we've already established.
Right here.
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
We hit land.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
Go.
He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
You got that right.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Maybe.
We heard you scream. Any idea what you might've seen?
Leave it.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Who?
Nothing.
Yeah, I heard about that.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
Oh I love to cook. I guess most women wouldn't invite a man over on the first date, but I believe you should trust your instincts. When I talked to you on the phone you just seemed so... I don't know... harmless. Ready for ice cream?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
What do you mean?
Huh?
You can count on me, sir!
Then why do you hate me so much?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Hey Josh.
Forget it...
I know, she needs to die immediately.
How perfect.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
God, it's so totally pathetic.
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
Oh yeah.
Come on, it's too late now...
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
Oh yeah...
What are you talking about?
It's always closed...
Let's go hassle Josh.
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
No way... when?
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Which one?
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
We were such desperate sluts back then.
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
Yeah, thanks.
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
He came into work.
I said "great"...
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Tell me what?
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Well why do I care about that?
Indian records?
Watch my stuff.
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
Yeah, well...
I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
Jesus!
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Jesus, Seymour.
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
Hooray for me.
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
Yeah, well "Cook's" is just a made up name. When they originally opened back in 1922 they were named "The Coon Chicken Inn" -- that's an early painting of their first logo.
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
So, what happened?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
And you like them?
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
Can you at least let me in?
What about this?
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
They're Seymour's.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
Yeah.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
I don't know... where is she, then?
Why? What did she tell you?
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
-malaria epidemic; very sudden.
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
How; we don't know where they are?
You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
Starling?
I'm calling it my "contraption"- we're going to surround it with a boma- a fence, to you- and we're going to leave a small opening opposite that door.
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
You never had it.
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
Have you got that in writing? 
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
Might be exciting for you.
What did I do?
Has it ever done that before?
Have you ever failed?
It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
Don't they have to be?...
Not for me- I'm too bulky and it's your idea, you go up there.  Take the others to the water tower for the night.
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
Since his beard was red.
He doesn't. He needs nobody. But we have hunted many times...  ...he knows I am afraid of lions...
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Do you ever see him?
How is he these days?
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
You never asked me, and every time I brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Good-bye, Peter.
It was full of this awful pink ooze.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Same difference.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Okay.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
My pleasure.
-- the sorrow --
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Yes.
Did I forget something?
Like what?
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
Objection.  Irrelevant and immaterial.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
Hello, Venkman.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
I knew that.
A hundred and five years?  He really hung on, didn't he.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
And we're the ...
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
Butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  I've had it with you.
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
Hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  Are you nuts? If anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  The judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I'm Peter --
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Wonder what?
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
So what do you think it was?
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
That's a violin concerto.
This is terrible.  Either there's a monster in my kitchen or I'm completely crazy.
Goodbye.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
I want you inside me.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
We'll get back to you.
Is that a game?
I think it's the food of the future.
What calls?
Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
Are you Peter Venkman?
You could say that.
Forget it, Venkman.  You had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  Now it's my turn, smart-ass.
See!  They are using drugs.
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yes.  I don't like this.
I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
Will you guys relax?  We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations.  The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
Yeah, I can smell it.
Oh, shit!
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
Gozer.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
Neutronize.  System shut.
That appears to be the case.
Uh-huh.  I've heard about the rockfall, Ray. I think you've been spending too much time with Spengler.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
To go into business for ourselves.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
I don't think it's Shandor.
What?  What popped in there?
Judgement Day ...
Right.  We'll believe anything.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
You can't do that!  You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
You're coming back?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Yes?  Go on!
The dangerous man, Caesar, is the man who doesn't care.
You flatter me, Caesar.
We have to stop the Germans now!
I'm serious.
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
I met with Falco, and the Senators have agreed to call for a truce with the Germans.
Narcissus will never support you, Caesar, he has too much of a philosophical temperament.
Where is the emperor and the army, soldier?
Yes, Caesar.
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I'll nose around...
But have never been?
You don't know how wrong you are.
Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
Why do you play at being drunk?
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Would that Marcus had lived.
He killed his father and then my family...
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
He's like you, sir, too tough for the Gods to swallow.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Tomorrow?
On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
What deal?
Greeks?
They're studying with Cynics.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
I am the man who might save your life -- give you a bit more life at any rate.  I am Proximo Palindromos head of this gladiatorial school which is named after me.  I own this school and everything that's in it.  You're in it!  But why?  What did a Roman general do to get himself condemned to the Colosseum? Understand, we usually get corn thieves and pick pockets.  Please, I separated you from the others because...  ... my nose tells me you've been condemned for important reasons.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
Alive... I'm alive...
Lucky it didn't step on his head.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
No.
I'd love some.
No.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Yes.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
No.
That woman --
That woman. The older woman.
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
I've never been to it.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
What?
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
My belt.
I don't know.
Tomorrow?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
No.
Is the doctor anywhere?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
What?
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
No. 
Right.
What for?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
What?
Well I don't know.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Yes, I have --
What if he did?
Why is it?
Get away from that door.
Let me out!
Yes.
A drink? Of course.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
This is all terribly wrong.
How about art.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Don't you?
I don't.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
Calm down, Benjamin.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Thank you.
No we don't.
Not exactly.
Is it?
Don't tell Elaine.
Why not?
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Let's drop it.
I see.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
Then give me your word you won't.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Sure.
What?
Not if you don't want to.
But I don't want you to make up something.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
What about it?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
No. She doesn't know about it.
I've got to go.
Ben, can I say something to you?
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Dad -- can you listen --
They are?  Come on.
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Well?
No.
What about the money?
Not with strangers.
Dictation.  You know...
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
You're very funny --
Of course.
Sorry.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Yes --
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
What do you want here?
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
Oh -- 
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
No?
A little strange, Baron.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
The war dropped him here and forgot him.
Please, Baron -- forgive me -- not now -- here she is.
I did not ask your advice.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Good heavens. What for?
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Send his bags up to my room.
You are ill.
The Grand Hotel.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Stay where you are.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Yes -- that --
Yes.
I never danced before -- in public.
Yes --
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
Oh yes, of course.
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
No -- only occasional jobs. 
You pay me.
Perhaps. 
Have you got it now?
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Well -- you want me?
Well?
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Oh, yes.
I had to arrange about the trip.
Exactly.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
He likes to play the great man.
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Goodnight, Suzette.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
What -- what is it? Last night...
There was -- there was.
Good morning, Gru -- your --
But when did he go? How do you know?
I could not think of not accepting.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
No news yet?
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Well -- gentlemen.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
My son was in the hospital --
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
You'll never shit right again.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
Roy? He's always crying.
I like you, too.
Fine.
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
Goody!
And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
What is?
Lead on.
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
Only one tooth?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
I guess I owe you my life.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
I pay my debts.
No. That was the point.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Mm?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
Because it's comfortable.
We'll rent a car.
You ain't seen nothin.
I'll sign that affidavit.
I'm a salesman.
Myra, I'm not following this.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Where?
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
Open your door.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
But the setup's there. It's there now.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
I'm happy the way I am.
) What?
Yes?
Gun?
Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
It's Blake.  Meet me at Grand View.
Sweet dreams, Blake.
It's Amy Kramer.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
Nothing's missing?
You're so predictable.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
Just forget it...
I was trying to protect you from this...
John, you can't help her now.
That would work.
Why not?
I came to see you.
Can I come in?
Then you come out here.
Okay... thank you.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
Michael Meyers.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Can't you hold it?
I did alright.
You're unbelievable.
He's in the bathroom.
Shit, Beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? It's only Halloween.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
Guess so ...
You can't expect us to stay here --
Danny!!!
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
You'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, Kara.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Wait a minute ...
But surely Rogers isn't --
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
Please try to understand, Terence. I've already made up my mind.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
An old friend.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
Good.  I want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
No!!!
One thing, anyway--at least Penelope didn't throw out all your crap.  I bet Alice threw out all my crap after I'd been gone a week.
The hell with the diamonds!
Go home.
Let's talk about it some other time.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
Really?
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
I just want one true adventure before I die.
It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
As a matter of fact--
As a matter of fact--I am home.
Is anybody besides you here now?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
She met him at college.
"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy."
England?
I don't know.
The smallest thing I've got.
Welcome to manhood, you little sparrowfart!  Load that gun!
I'm talking to you gently now.
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
You are woman.  I know woman well.
How do you do, Mrs. Ryan?  I'd heard you were beautiful, and so you are.  Am I intruding here?
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
Nothing would please me more.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
A trip, you mean?
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
I don't think so.
He'd never seen a corpse.  He's seen a dozen now.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
Almost a Christmas scene.
If he thinks he's man enough.
I'm teaching my son to be a man.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
There it is.  Give it to me.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
You've killed women?
Gentlemen--that's nice.
It's always locked.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Hello, Mother.
Oh dear.
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
And her fianc!
I've got to run!
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Are you've seen it work cures?
What for?
Now who's being cruel?
I'm high as a kite.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
I've struck my blow.
My violin is avenged!
New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
I've enjoyed being man.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
That is sad.
It's my father's birthday--that's all.  That's all.  Who cares about that?
Everybody talks about how rotten kids act.  Grownups can be pretty rotten, too.
What a relief!
I was afraid to ask.
I didn't know that.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
That man is your father.
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
Keeps fairies away!
He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
Something happens to my confidence.
You figure!
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
How long has this been going on?
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Take plenty of cigars.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
What?
Tonight's the night.
It is?
As long as he keeps out of the park.
He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
We met here earlier this evening.
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Goodbye.
I'm sick of this argument.  I just have one more thing to say: If you elect a President, you support him, no matter what he does.  That's the only way you can have a country!
You can believe that if you want. I talk to guys like you, and I want to commit suicide.  You get that weight-lifting set I sent you?
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
But is she, has...
Well, I want to...
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
That's all you got, three girls?
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Sam?
Something like that. How much do you make?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
A friend.
At least I'm a growing person.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
No, please go on.
What makes you so sure?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him again. Where does he live?
But then you'll forget about me.
They are?
Who made it?
I just heard. Who is he?
It's just a name.
Does she know anything about this?
No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
What?
Where does he hang out?
I want to meet Ratan.
Ratan!
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
I don't know nothing, man.
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
What do you think of that? Or this?
He asked me. You going with anybody?
Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
To anybody.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Yes, I am.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Wait here.
What kind of a car is it?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Not very.
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Eh, no.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Oh.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
What do you mean?
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Look.
But this is public property.
Look, the ice is melting.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Well, I don't...
Superb.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Well, they're my species.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
I have a sore throat.
What?
At a funeral.
I don't care what people say.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
Why?
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
To pit your own life against another.
Another man's life in your sights.
ZAT!
Well, I don't...
Oh yes. That's fine.
We've always been here.
Julia.
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
It certainly is.
You a doctor, too?
God, I wish I could say no. This is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
Then why are you here?
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Story of my life.
I'm lucky that way.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
Red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
We're on the move.
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Yup. Sixty years old by our count. But he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: He's barely out of his teens.
Anung-un-Rama...
I knew those men better than you did --
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
Those comics -- They never got the eyes right.
Good night.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
No. Myers is taking me.
60% OF THE WOMEN IN THIS WORLD ARE NAMED "LIZ".
I know.
Two steps back, please.
Oh, sod you.
What's the problem?
Not much.
It's just a puzzle box.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
Stay the fuck away from me.
You can keep them.
First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
That's right. This is Frank you're talking to, remember? FRANK.
That's right. Who are you?
I'm very happy.
His blood... on the floor... It brought me back.
What do you want me to do.
You're hurting.
I said no.
Which is where?
Oh my God.
Ah!
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
No. I'm not.
Oh Christ. Julia...
It looks like a bomb's dropped.
Larry....
O.K.
I've seen worse.
Fine.
What?
There's a first time for everything.
No.
We don't need a bed, do we?
I prefer the floor.
What's wrong?
Wait a moment --
My father doesn't answer. I have to go find him.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
Call me tomorrow.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Finished?
No. It's all over.
I have to get out.
Just upstairs.
It's late.
Please. I want to see you home. All right?
We walk.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
She's so damn... English.
Are you alright ?
Will you GO, damn you?
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
Say it.
Well what's the point in that?
We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
But now I kind of like it.
I'm not snickering.  I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
Because it's a brilliant film.  It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
No way.
We're getting that anyway.
They always seemed...
Do not get ahead of yourself.
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Nice friend.
Yeah, sure...
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
I'll tape it for you.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
I want a tape.
-- FUCK OFF!
Do it.  Do it.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
I should be so lucky.
Hi.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
And do you like it that way?
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
Just the obvious stuff.
No.
I haven't felt like it.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
I hate him too.  So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
Mmm hmm.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Well, think about it.
I can't talk right now.
Pigsty.
Pig died.
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
Yes, of course.
Uh... No.
I don't want to go back.
Hi.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
You're tougher.
No use.
Wanna go to dinner?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Would you marry me if I was?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.
How're you holding up?
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
It's a crematorium.
What difference does it make?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Everything go alright?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
Yeah.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
Sixty.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Well we don't.
Sure.
Claymore.
Thanks.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
I'd like to ask you about the claymore.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Basil the II.
Good day, Miss Cartwright.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
Tradition.
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
No one knows you're here?
You're a fool.
You've been listening to rumors.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
At least.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
No!
I'm just curious.
Now there's a new topic.
Spare me the details.
It'll never stick.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
It's that important?
Not who.  What.  Worstick's a town in Pennsylvania.
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
I am from Spain.  And I would like a moment of your time.
Pheasant.
I don't know why.
This is madness!
No!
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Me arm hurts.
Muy Bien!
But I did live.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Tradition.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
So sure?
We need more time.
Not likely.
You seem to understand a great deal.
We have no understanding.
Stay out of it.
Figure she's with him?
Sit.
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Not so long.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
It doesn't.
What are you getting at?
I thought it only proper to pay me last respects to the family.
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
We were very close.
What's the idea of locking this?
Hello, Bensinger.
No. Roy. Roy V.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Thank you.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
No. My mother.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Yes, I know...  Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Thanks a lot.
Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
Say, I want to be sure, too!
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Get away, Svengali.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Please! Will you just --
Where'd you meet this man?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Thanks.
Thank you.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
We're not interested.
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
I get it!
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
Okay, Walter. 
All right, Walter.
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
What did you do with her?
Louie!
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it.  Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Murder, uh?
Who did you talk to?
Don't tell me you were worried!
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Take that mush out of your mouth!
I'm busy, Duffy.
What?
They can't do that to me!
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
I can't complain.
Good coffee, isn't it?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
Yeah. But I --
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
An attempt to ruin us!
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
I did.  Hold the wire.
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Now, Hildy --
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Five hundred dollars.
I'm telling you!
What did you do with her?
I'll go right after it.
And up a dime.
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Huh?
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
Mother!
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
Very simple, Earl.
Don't move!
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Ssh!
Yeah, I'm feelin' fine.
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
The what?
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
I give that marriage six months.
Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
No, she didn't.
Who told you that?
I don't mind.
Bloody.
Won't they have maps?
It's easy. I've done it.
He's the worst liar.
They've got the real thing outside.
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
I don't know?
Please yourself.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Propaganda. We've been had.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
Bugger the Buffs.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
It looks....foreign.
You taste it.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
Fair enough.  The river.
Out.
Who said anything about love?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
Up to six weeks, I think.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Yikes.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Go straight up about another mile... til we hit Cherrypicker Road and turn right... it ain't far from there.
OK.
Come on.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
You shouldn't a done that.
Yeah, well we like to get fucked up and do fucked up shit, you know what I mean?
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
What's that?
Way out here?
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
Here he comes.
He won't move.
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
Lock the fucking doors.
I gotta open the gate.
It won't work.
Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
That's nice.
He should be back in a couple hours.
Grab Mary and come inside.
Fried chicken.  Anybody want some?
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
Sleeping.
I resign.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Aw Christ, Jerry. We can't see anything now, it's too dark. Let's forget it.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
You find something, Georgie?
Huh?
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
What!
Enough with the stupid voices.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Don't worry, I'm gone.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
What! God damn, how many?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Right...  ...come on.
Excuse me for a second.
We found one.
Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up.
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
Not at all.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
I just want to talk.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
God, you're beautiful.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
I don't know. Something's missing.
We still have you and I.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Very well.
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Won't he be able to tell?
Really?
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
Where?
How's it going?
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
I like you, too, Nathan.
Terrific. Can't wait!
Yes, darling.
A deer?
It might behoove us to turn back at this point.
If it's a person, why should we go see it? It's not like it's nature or anything. It's just a person.  Sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. They live in the woods because they're anti-social, Lila. We have to respect that.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
What?
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Your entire body?
You have to shave? Like an ape?
You are an animal.
No.
I'm just preoccupied.
Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.
Shh. It's okay.  It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want.
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Have you?
I had sold my fucking soul.
Oh boy!
Thank you very much for that.
Should I come with?
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Lila...
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
Now, Puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. I don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.
Yahoo!
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
No.
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Yep.
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
Next game, ten bucks.
It's open...  What'll you have?
Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
You know what's good for him?
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
That's the way it's done.
You ever played billiards before?
Thought you only drank milk.
Why?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Hi. How's business?
You know everybody, don't you?
Where do I sign?
I been thinking.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Well, I win sometimes.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
I don't know.
All right. Five hundred.
How're the hands?
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
I'm a businessman, kid.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Get with what?
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
What for? To play Fats again?
Is that what you think?
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
Glad to meet you.
How much?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Okay?
Oh man, you're way out of our league.
Ten dollars.
Hi.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Since four.
What bus?
Eight o'clock.
Thanks. I will.
No, not always.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Give me a drag.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
I've got something in my bag.
What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
A loser?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
That's right.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
Thousand dollars a game.
My name is Robert.
Listen to me, my blood somehow... helped you.  It could help all of you.  We could find some way to --
Yes.
What?
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
Have you always had it?
Yes.
Yes.
Busy.  I went swimming and prepared a new vehicle.  A big vehicle.
Besides, if we get a lot of work done this summer it'll be done.
You got that right.
I guess you could say that.
Round back.
That's the Air Force Base.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
I left it at work.
Good night.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner.  I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Why, yes.  Why?
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
I'd believe him.
I don't see anything.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Who are you calling?
There was a man named Colonel Wilson, from the Air Force Base.  He was talking in our class.  He said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I'll bet he could do something.
What happened to your other slipper?
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
All right.  I'll be right back.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
You don't understand. You have to leave Washington.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
We'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
Punched the President? Oh my god.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
More than likely.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
Then get them out of there.
You don't move soon. I'll begin to decompose.
Dad, don't start.
She didn't take my name when we were married.
Moishe, please, don't talk.
I'm making a mess.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
I think our secret is out. They're headed right for us.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
Yes, I am.
Butt-munch.
Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
But, Mr. President...
We're leaving.
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  Hey, you wanna see them?
Many worlds...
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
What is it?
Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.
Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
In that case, I permit you.
Lower me down.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Are you sure?
Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
I can reach it. I can reach it...
Junior!
Don't call me that, please.
I came to get you! What do you think?
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Right.
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
So did I.
You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
My lucky charm.
What???
All right Dad -- tell me.
What final challenge?
Booby traps?
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
Dad, how can you?
It happens to me all the time.
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
"J".
Ready.
Come on -- come on!
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
You think so?
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
You should have been there...
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Sure, Indy -- three tickets! You, me and Wu Han --
You don't like him do you?
Behind you!
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
Long ago -- before my father's father.
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
Siam.
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
Their children?
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
A SNAKE!!
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
First of all -- don't panic!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
PET IT??!!
Keep stroking it!
Oh really?
I've never been so hungry in my life...
What -- the bug?
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
Yes.
No... they won't kill me.
Go!
Not quite.
And they don't even know what it really is.
You're not gonna believe this...
Al.
What is your name?
Right.
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just went there for a job.
Loading a gun.
Kill myself.
Then I'm crazy.
Yeah.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
You gotta help.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
I can't remember..
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Nothing!
The airport! Hey, wait a minute.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
The beach.
Good Idea!
You eat it.
Don't just stand there, say something.
What?
...Rene...
Rene...
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
Why not?!
The blond...GRUNER. A killer.
This just won't work.
Is that all?
No. What will you do.
It wasn't like that.
You found her.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Follow her.
That's not funny.
What do I do?
I told you, I have a feeling...
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
Where've you been?
Looks like you can have all you want.
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
Thing is...I think I'm in love with her.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
You're lovely.
I mean it!  No one else would have helped. I take it all back, everything I've said about you.
That's nice.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
It'll remind me of you.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
We don't even know where to start. What about these people? What do we do with them?
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
I think I've heard of you.
What?
Well what?
Oh....Sure.
What?
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
I noticed you staring.
We have Henekin, Kirin... Very good, sir.
Nothing.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
...I'm looking for someone.
No. No one to speak of.
Yes?
Where?
...right here too.
Like there's someone else here.
...Rene.
Me still. They left you alone?
Why?
Disinterest?
You did.
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Last night?
You did.
He must be a good friend.
One chip?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
Ryuji and Gruner.
He plays it all the time.
We figure out if it's in here.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
Get us one.
Where would you go to sell a chip?
I asked him.
They'll listen to what we say in here.
They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
What?
...Piece of mind.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Thanks.
Why?
Hi, Daddy.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Okay.
She was playing with my Pooh doll again...
Instant rice...?
What's that outside, Daddy?
You got a deal. 
I'll be there.
Monday.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
...fuck is this? Fuck!
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
What caliber is your gun?
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
Hey, Lowell.
How grave?
I'm told unusual promises were made to Wigand.
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Call me back in ten.
You're sure you want to do this?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
No, thank you.
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
Where should I wash them?
Who's calling?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Alright.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Good, well ask him if Arabic is his second language.
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
Alright. What did you think?
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
I did? What do I tell a source on the next tough story? Hang in with us. You'll be fine... maybe?
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
If you want to do it.
Good. I want to talk to you.
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
Why am I gonna mention your name?
No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
I can't talk about it. The work I was supposed to do... might have had some positive effect. I don't know... it could have been beneficial.  Mostly, I got paid a lot. I took the money. My wife was happy. My kids had good medical. Good schools. Got a great house.  I mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?
You okay?
Good.  You have kids?
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Tempura...
I'm not pushing you around!  I'm asking you questions.
I don't think you really understand --
I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
Yeah, great.
I don't know what to do.
You mean... since this morning?
A can opener! A $39.95 can opener. I canceled payment... It was junk.  You ever bounce a check, Lowell? You ever look at another woman's tits? You ever cheat a little on your taxes?  Whose life, if you look at it under a microscope, doesn't have any flaws...?
What does this have to do with my testimony?
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
She's okay.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
That's why we hire scientists...
He --
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
What part?
Set one side for Bel Air.
What?
Asian? No.
It's your move, Miles.
So, that's good, right?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
No.
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
I'll be right back.
He wants a reconciliation.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
Howard is a beautiful person.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
Thank you.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
She didn't love you?
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
No.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
Miles.
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
What do you want?
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
What kind of "stuff?"
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
It's not something I wanted either.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
He has a reputation for being tough.
Hello Miles.
I want to be exposed.
Yes?
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
Heh heh.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
We've outlined a settlement...
Video.
Well -- is that possible?
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
Muriel Rumsey.
Maybe next time.
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Oh, no, sir. No different than
"I found a million dollar baby"
Yes, I knowbut
The reward.
You're a peculiar chap.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine!
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
No.
He doesn't think so much of you either.
He's marvelous!
I'm sorry you read it.
I suppose so.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that
But the lady says
. . . turn."
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Shut up!
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
The pleasure is all mine.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  Youyou had it pressed.
I can't go out like this.
Heyyou're little, aren't you?
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
Santa Claus?
Well, you were!
You weren't so bad yourself.
Next week "East Lynne."
I don't trust that chatterbox.
Not as long as I'm alive.
Why, haven't you?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
knowbut
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
Hitch-hiking.
Raw?
I hate the horrid stuff.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a carand I won't use my thumb.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Darling!
Okay.  Cottage Number Three.
Yeah, swell.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Whome?  Want to see me?
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time.
Do you know?
Yep! The Walls of Jericho. 
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Left twenty minutes ago.
Isn't he here?
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Oh, excuse me. 
Bridge washed outaround Dawson.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Yes.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
ain't got a hat
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
Orange, New Jersey.
Yeah. Just babies.
The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist.  They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture doesn't even match.  I'm beginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or someone purporting to be Oswald, had gotten into Cuba, come back, then killed the President, the American public once again would've screamed for a Cuban invasion...
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
Three, four.  He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember...
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Yeah, I guess you do.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
It went to the goddamn FBI and they didn't find a goddamn thing.  It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could've taken off Oswald at the morgue.  There's no chain of evidence, Bill.  And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository?  One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser, described by Deputy Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going with my gut here.  He's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's in a name, right?  In intelligence, they're assumed to be fake.  A name is sort of like a postbox number, a code - several different people can use the same name, right?  Then why can't somebody be using Oswald's name?
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he call me?
Where you going, boss?
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks like natural causes.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Photographs - compromising stuff. And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays for keeps...  I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit.  I taught him everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd talk about his kid, y'know, really wanted her to grow up with a chance, but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency fucked him.  Just like they're gonna fuck me.
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Why Galveston?
And then Sunday?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just talk to us on the record and we'll protect you.  I guarantee it.
Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said...
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
No, you don't!
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
No, I don't think I am, Susie.  Anyone else?
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters, don't you, Mr. Garrison.
Nonsense.  What next?
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
It'll be off the record, honey. I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A quiet little chat between gentlemen.
It's going to get worse, honey.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children.  The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing.  You didn't even notice he was there.  He came to me bawling his little eyes out.  Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
Huh?
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
What are you driving at, boss?
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
And it ain't pretty  ..."the AD has spent more than $8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November, 1966.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
We need him back.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
Ever ask him?
Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
Was he there often?
You just need some sleep, Lou.  It won't look so bad when...
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
Splendid, love to see them.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
Well I don't know what can be done, Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.
I understand.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
I found out.
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you wanted him.
What time do you have to be there?
I'm not saying another word.
While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
Okay.
Can I see your I.D.?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
We could stop at the Hilton by the airport.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
I am. Have a seat.
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
It looks nice.
Uh-huh.
Why?
I'm old enough to be her father.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
When did you decide?
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
Set him up.
Why?
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I know.
I'm just tired in general.
What the fuck is that shit?
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
Who's the other one?
What's her story?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
But you didn't do that.
Not in the fitting room.
Gimme one anyway.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Beaumont Livingston?
Dreaming.
Keep it between us girls?
Sure.
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
Go sit over in that chair.
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
They already know it's you.
A woman.
I can do that.
I need to talk to you alone.
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
Uh-huh?
And your point is?
All right already.
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
I dunno.
I'm in my underwear.
An employee I had to let go.
Sure.
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass, Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's ever been, anyway.
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
Did you get it?
I shot her.
Twice. In the parking lot.
In the chest and stomach.
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
It's in there.
What?
Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world! Let me tell you the reason, motherfucker! The reason is, your ass ain't worth a shit no more!
Have fun.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
Where would you like me to put my ash?
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
You think you could do that?
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
I got some more business for ya.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess.
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I'm running a business?
Is that what I think it is?
She got off, huh?
I thought you might be asleep.
I have a bond receipt for you to sign.
Uh-huh.
And where's Jackie?
That I gotta see.
Have her bring the money here.
I know where to turn.
Yeah.
No.
It's Beaumont.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
No, thanks.
I see.
Me, too.
Stop!!!!
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
There's nothing to expose.
Maybe there's a larger truth.
Now what?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
But the paper ...
No. Not really ...
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
I thought you said she didn't say much.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
I know.
What? By myself?
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
But I see them.
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
Save me!
No. Don't move me.
Thanks.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
I don't let anybody call me that.
Lemme see.
Show me Della!
It's gone to the top.
Get your clothes off.
That's your decision.
What kind of man are you?
Here. I'll do it.
Am I home?
Are we in Brooklyn?
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
Why didn't you call me?
I can do anything I want.
It might be for me.
I love you when you're angry.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
Sit down!
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
Long time ago.
Like it was yesterday.
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
I don't know.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
Push 'em back.
For what? For seeking the truth?
What is wrong with you?
Help me!
Call my chiropractor.
Last night! They were as real as you are!
Nothin' much.
I need to see you.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
You tellin' me? How many times can you die, huh?
You can't talk in Brownsville?
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
He doesn't like it.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Pause play.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
What do you mean, not enough time?
Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
Done?
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Rizzo did.
I think I broke my arm.
What are you gonna do, tell me?
What are you doing back?!!
We could convert fission transistors.
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
And now we're all out of it.
Suit up.
Use the thrusters and you'll be fine. We'll huddle together out there.
I am an expert!
Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
We have to get off this ship.
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
What if we don't?
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
Not so bad.
I know you.
We wait. I need about fifteen. Call me if there are any changes. If she farts I want a full report.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
We're screwed.
Again?! Jesus!
They'll make it.
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Later.
Crutch?
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Oh shit! There he is!
Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
I love you.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
4You're not going anywhere.
You're crazy!
Exactly.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Have to pump her steady, s'all.
He's taken him!
Here? You gotta be kiddin'.
Michael! Come inside!
What'll I tell the kids?
My kids were on that beach...
Who are you?
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.
You could say that.
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here...
What do we do?
I wish it would rain...
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
Set?
Is anyone having this...?
Is that a boat?
This is Quint, Missus.
Transplants?
Let me see your hands...
Anti-Shark cage.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
No -- comin' right at us! Slow ahead, he'll hit us head on --  Slower! Throttle back ---
He's under!
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Cool.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
I totally heard you did.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
What?
No...
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Yeah. That was me.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
Yup.
I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
No... I guess not.
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
Hon, did you get expelled?
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
I don't get a klepto vibe from you. Evil genius? Maybe. Arsonist? Wouldn't rule it out.
What do you play?
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
That suits you.
You're something else.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
What's the matter?
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Your name, please?
Congrats.
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
You mean like couples?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Thundercats are go!
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
There are ads? For parents?
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Well, you are kind of... convex.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Nesting, huh? Are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
It all just happened so fast. We put that ad in the paper. I thought it would take months if, you know, ever and then -- boom -- Two weeks later, she's in our living room.
Looks like it, yeah.
Yeah, downtown.
Could I try that?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers.
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
Yeah.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
What happened to Adele?
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
I still think we should have met them first.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
I'm finished.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
No.
Shut your mouth.
...You're hurting me...
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
17.
Did what take?
Yeah.
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Yeah.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
What for? That guys a dick.
You think?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
The cartoon?
Right.
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Yeah me too nigga.
Oh. You like her?
Darcy?
Yeah. She's only 13.
Yeah.
Did you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.  He had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
I'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.
Fifteen for me.
Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
Why not? You stink.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Don't look for him. He's doing fine. He's gotta girl. He's fuckin' her right now in Steven's parents' room. So do ya know Joe.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
Is it cold?
You were?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
Yeah. I can understand that.
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
I think you're like the best girl I've ever kissed.
Come on.
No, Fidget, I...
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
What?
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Yeah?
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Whah is dissdee?
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
It's like...
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Yeah.
Hi Telly. Where you been?
It's me. Telly.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Nah.
I don't know, eight or nine.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
It's very monotonous.
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
You are!  I don't like you.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
His victims aren't random.  It only means that they appear to be random. There's a connection, we just have to find it.
No it wasn't.
I'm positive.
What?
I want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
What was your relationship with her?
Sanderson?
It's a voice modulator.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Did anyone stand out?
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Who is this?
I haven't got time for this.
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
You're not going to tell me that.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
Because she's the type.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
You like to brag, don't you?
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
No!  Wait!!
You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
Okay.  Run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the Island.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
I just can't believe it.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Boys.
Of course.
Thanks, David.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Six, eight hours tops.
I'd say at least eighteen hours.
We're not sure.
It's important.
Call dispatch.  Double the patrols.  I want that area blanketed.
What did he mean by Huxley?
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
Through a rental agency.
It doesn't make sense.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
I signed the confession.  What about the car?
It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Of course.
How could you?  Unless you were there.
No.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
What do you want on it?
What's wrong?
Can I come in?
But I do.
It could be anything.
Frank told me.
Of course not.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
That's worse.
About what?
No. They watch me closely, but they haven't harmed me.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
Does the Queen live?
I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
Everyone of his race is born knowing the day of his death.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
She is too deep. The curved tunnel we saw is part of the Vortex, the place of The Beast.
No. She must agree of her own free will.
He thinks you betray him with Lyssa.  Colwyn! The waters deceive you!
Let us wish him peace.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
Use your sword.
You're coming with us.
I forbid you!
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Perhaps he expected to eat it.
What business?
He saved our lives.
To the place where Death lives.
I'm all right.
Not sleepy, either?
What kind of friend do you think I am?
Yes, my lord.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
Would you settle for a boar?
We'll meet you at the inn.
You can have half.
I only want one.
And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Get me down from here you louts or I'll turn you all into pigs!
We have plenty of hares.
I must take the old man to see some sick children. Kegan will guard you.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
Then he will die!
How many did you lose?
Such a vision will be opposed. Who seeks it?
I will seek the Fortress for you.
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
The Widow of the Web?
She has the power to kill.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
No, she was not as beautiful.
No.
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
No.
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Good.
What, for example?
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
OK.
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
Why?
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
...Don't you like me?
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
I see. You're good, because I didn't hear anything.
Huh? That's smart!
Huh, that's good!
...And how much is it?
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
No... Dino's.
Where?
I won't let you die.
I think my uncle is suffering from a condition called Mania which is linked with depression.  It is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. Sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
A couple days to a few months if untreated.
Pardon?
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
You do?
The flowers... they're beautiful.
It's just a regular day.
Honey, I told you.  If it makes you happy, we should just do it.
I don't follow.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
Then why?
You like to take walks?
Please not, 'The two kinds of people' speech.
No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
Yes.
If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
Pacifica, California.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
Maurice and Ellen Parker... it was issued in Philly... Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home.  Why?
P-A-R-K-E-R.  Right.  Get on the horn with Philly.  Call me here.
Jumped where?
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Umm, Coalville Utah.
Maybe.
No.  No... I won't be here for a while.  The store will be closed in the interim.
Yes.
Walking where?
I told you.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Steph.
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Good morning.
What do you think I should get?
No.
Water.
Of course.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
You OK out there?
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
What?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
No?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Can we just forget it?
They wouldn't know.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
Yuri... are you...
That's right.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
He was thirty-four years older than you. That doesn't sound so good to a jury.
Get up.
That's not what's important.
Who could better understand than me?
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Two a year since I was twelve. You do the math.
Who's askin'?
Tell him, Paulette.
That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
Thank you!
Is everything okay?
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Donovan's firm is defending a major murder case and his caseload is so heavy he's taking on first year interns.
Aristotle.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Trust me. You've got the equipment, you just need to read the manual.
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
Name?
Oh, God, was this like an RSVP thing?
You guys are so sweet!
You think?
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
What?!
Margot!
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
The bags under your eyes. You're an attractive man, but you need to take better care of yourself.
What?!
Are you asking me on a date?
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
Is he the only one?
Helloo... he just had lunch with his grandmother. You know he got "The Rock".
I just don't understand what went wrong --
Absolutely!
Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Where's Warner?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
You should. Do you have a resume?
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
Harvard. Law school.
What, like it's that hard?
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Thank you.
Really?
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Then we smash 'em?
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
Do it now!
Kill me... I want... so nice...
Or looked so beautiful...
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Who might these friends be?
Dance, Jack!  The night's but begun.
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk?  Is me music not to your liking?  Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
Didn't you now?  Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
What does she want from me?
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Will you lead me to her?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
It would appear so.
Careful, lad.
The colt's still too small.
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Nay.  That's but to distract the casual visitor.  A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
We'll find it.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
It doesn't matter.
I don't... understand.
Sapphire!
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
That's it then... the ring!
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
Wolf-slayer, worm-sticker... give a cheer for the champion!
No, no, no... this is different!
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Sorry.
If you like.
Sport, indeed.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
To fetch your napkin.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
I don't want it on me.
Oh, la...
Then, perchance you'll me.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
And I... love you...
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
And am I not fair?
And sweet?
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
And as barren of love as stone.
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
Bah!  You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
It's done... we'll never catch him.
Sigurd the Volsung slew Fafnir with that blade... See the line where Regin welded the break?
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
That very nice.
He was there and then he wasn't!
I don't think Dad wants you home.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Uh...using Josh like that.
Has he eaten anything at all?
I'll survive.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
Hi.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I'll get your back.
Yeah.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
I don't want you to!
Why are you so stupid?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
Are you afraid of heights?
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
George just never really...aimed that high.  Even with not hitting a rabbit.  I knew you were doing that, by the way. That's why I stopped doing it with you. You were no fun.  It was always like you were frightened.  Quiet and boring.
I've been dreading you.
What are you on?
He buys and sells the world.
Maybe that's too long.
Yes, it is.
Not a shower.
I want you both to stay.
Thank you.
It's midnight.  What's the matter, Sam?
I'll ask.
To check up on me?
I almost saw Catalina.
A friend of yours is here.
Hi, Mom.
I know.  Why?
Nothing.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Yes.
Here.
I'd build a house.
I can die trying.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
Isn't that weird?  I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  Six years.  I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
We just weren't very much alike, I guess. I don't know.  I liked your dad more than I liked you.
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
I know there's an explanation.
She's a little sad, is all.
Where is he?
He doesn't answer.
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
Why call me?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
I can't leave the house?
Which?
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
What did I say?
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
I can't pick you up.
It's not my back that's killing me.
I could use the money.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
Should I?
I know.
No.
I don't know what I'm doing.
Yeah.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
Why?
Yes, it is.
Hell with him. It ain't that.
But you can't.
Is Spanky here?
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
Claude Banks.
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Look, man, I don't want friendly conversation. I don't want to be your friend. I've seen your friends and I don't like them. I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job.
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
You're talking about giving up baseball to be a bank teller.
A loan officer?
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
What gave you that idea?
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
He's dead.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Wait up there, Claude. You give that guy your corn bread and the next thing you know you'll be ironing his shirts and clipping his toenails.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Claude.
What do you want, Claude?
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
I said you're soft.
I'm sick of watching Camp 12 win the championship. Every year they get to roast the victory pig and we get dick. This year I want that pig.
Him?
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Make 'em throw strikes.
They're called pilots! I'm serious, Ray. I'm not in the mood for one of your stupid, fucked-up plans right now.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
Don't touch that car.
An erection, huh? Haven't had one of those in a while.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
You didn't get ketchup?
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
'Preciate it. Claude.
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
Why ain't that pick swinging?
State of Mississippi wants this ditch cleared by sundown. You got that?!
You heard the boss! Let's move!
You heard what the man said! Move it!
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
I seen the bodies before they sealed 'em up. Them fellas sizzled up good. Looked like some shit from the X- Files.  Damn, that shit's nasty.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Just like Elvis.
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Excuse me, sheriff. As we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. We didn't kill anybody. Now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in New York.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
Jenny?
Greenville, that the nearest town?
You all been here a long time. Doesn't anybody ever escape from this place?
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
He's sick?
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Sure, why not?
Weed lowers the body temperature.  I read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's not me, moron.
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
Everything's fine, pop.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Definitely.
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
What was it called, sir.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
By she, do you mean he?
Peppermint... alright.
That way.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
I don't know?
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Anything to eat?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
Anybody we know?
I'm fine...  See you...
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
I never go upstairs. You're a nice old lady.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
Curious.
How a Sandman lives.
Why is it wrong to run?
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
You know.
You know something.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
I don't have much time.
Maybe you'll think of something...
Of course --
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
We'll be all right...  We will...
Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
How would anyone know? Even if we find it -- we can never go back.
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
You know, Jessica.
Of course.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
It's part of the hydrogalvanic system. The ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
What's that?
At least it's over...
It's all right with me. Is he here?
What makes you think so?
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Oh my... I'll try.
Where to? Hey, Lanie, I heard you were out of it for a while, too.
You gotta be kiddin'... This is the boulevard... You can't hear yourself think.
No, I'm okay.
Sure, I'm okay.
Yes, I thought my wife...
What is?
Or not so recently?
Yeah... Laurent.
You know what I think?
It's me...
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
So what do we do?
We should stop seeing each other.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Yeah.
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
Yeah. Call him.
Okay...
What about tonight?... Whatiya gonna do about Mr. Eddy tonight?
Alice?
Yes, I believe so.
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Sure.
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Do ya good.
Sit down.
What happened to me?
No.
The wife killer?
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
We'll get a tail put on him.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
Pete, what happened to you?
Coming up.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
But my head...
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Two detectives are coming out.
Why would anyone do something like this?
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
What?
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
I'm really glad you're doin' okay, Pete.
We just killed a couple of people...
Whatiya mean?
Yeah.
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
YOU'RE SORRY!!
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
Okay, brother.
I beg your pardon.
Now you're irritating and absurd!
Do you suppose we stopped someplace during the night and changed pilots?
Yes!
Will you stop squawking!
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Yes.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Nothing. Why?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
Over by that hill.
Well - I'm
How do you do?
He must have had a heart attack, or perhaps the fumes. When the plane landed he was dead.
That's intelligent.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
You have no disputes over women?
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
Then everything is quite all right, isn't it?
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
Suppose she should leave it?
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Don't believe him, Bob. He's just trying to get out.
Father Perrault is dead.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
Are you the High Lama?
That I be brought here? Who had that brilliant idea?
Yes.
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
What are you talking about?
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
Chang! Chang! Chang!
Why - I'm sorry - but I
You can't leave, George.
Is that all my story meant to you?
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
What was that?
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling like an idiot?
We'd be eternally grateful if you
Yes, I know.
I can't quite explain it, but everything is somehow familiar. The very air that I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet rooted in the good earth of this fertile valley, while its head explores the eternal. All the beautiful things I see, these cherry blossoms, you - all somehow familiar.  I've been kidnapped and brought here against my will. A crime, a great crime, yet I accept it amiably, with the same warm amiability one tolerates only from a very dear and close friend. Why? Can you tell me why?
Bump?
English!
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Please don't go.
Perhaps.
Cowan--
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
It's not even a fucking door.
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Well this didn't.
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Listen-- do me a favor-- don't mention the 140 thing--
Dee, you've been useful for 50 years.  We're clueless, you're tired. Why don't you go home and get some rest.
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
She didn't even know you. .
Just so I understand... you're "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  Or is it actually being an idiot?  Besides--
You don't know me at all.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Let's check am out.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
I dunno, man.  Maybe we should.
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Do his job.
There wasn't time, sport!
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
What is it?
Are you sure you don't?
They respond to fear, right?
Well I'm going to give them something to be afraid of.
No.
It's... coming.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
Noon exactly.
The what?
Wait-- listen--
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
They went right to the President.
Oh shit!
Just a guess.  But I think found a nest.
Can you see?
Can you see the balloon man?
Who wanted her little girl back?
She's still alive?
Found?  Where?
Yeah --
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
-- go blind.  I know.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
I understand.  Sir.
Yes, sir.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
Everybody runs.
I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.  You've created a world without murder.  So what if you had to kill someone to do it.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Everybody runs.
Red Ball -- double homicide: one male, one female.  Killer's male, white, 40's.
Georgetown.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Because it was going to fall.
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
It helps if you don't think of them as human.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
There's no way of knowing for sure. She could've forgotten whatever it is you're looking for...
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
That's great.
What a big boy.  How old are you?
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Once I even told him I loved him.
He's alive?
Crow.  I'm not gonna kill you.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
You say some of the children died?
Not if I stay away from him.
The safest place of all.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
He's dead, Lara.
No.  I don't think you do.  The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed?  He didn't mention him.  He didn't say his name even once.
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
Tell him not now.
What?
Wait, just a second...
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
Right here.
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Two?
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
You "friend's" a murderer and he ruined our perfect record.  Six years, not one damn murder...
Sure.  Raincheck.
We used to, every summer.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
To what?  Trap him?
You don't understand... they're a hive mind.  It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.
What are you talking about?
You're Bobby, right?
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
What if I gave you forty?
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Where's the place to go tonight?
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
No more.
Bullshit.
She's, uh, sleeping.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
There's no touching.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Quick drop. In and out.
This one?
Pshhh...
So, that's it. I'm out?
Yeah. Sorry.
You told him you liked him.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Nah, man...
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
You don't know where you're going?
You know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. Keeping it real. Know what I mean?
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Listen, man, we really gotta...
I know the number.
Bye.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
This paint sucks. The white shows through.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Shhh... Hello, room service?
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Don't even start.
Sold it, stole it, whatever...
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
I don't know.
So we're working?
About what?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
You got that right.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
What's up?
Why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
I'm your soldier.
Wait a minute. You want to look at fucking penguins now?
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
Why?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
Ricky. I'm trying to save this money. Understand? I'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
Let's just go now and wait.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
I'll be a minute.
What do you mean 'kinda?'
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
I didn't do anything --
The line's over there.
You see a Ricky Slade?
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
Cool. See you later.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Ugh...
Yes.
Where do you live?
He spoke to me. You want me to dis him?
What? Why am I bad?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Here...
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
You'll love it.
Go ahead. Open the fuckin things. You should each find fifteen hundred --
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
What?
Tell me.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Outfit? What's he talking about?
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
A rose by any other name would --
Who's up for a night on the town.
Bet you like that shit.
Yes, sir.
Just now.
Solid, daddy.
What you talking?
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
I don't want your money.
Yeah.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
You have enough worries of your own.
How old are you, Betty?
Yes.
Just hold me.
What do you think?
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
The talk is everywhere!
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
Dear heart, I love you.
Betty it's me. It's me.
Let's get out of this cold.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
Let some of us come down there.
Since when do you start telling Sister Betty my business? Since when? She has nothing to do with this. You tell me, not her, not anybody else.
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
Yes, sir, I did.
Sure, man.
Not yet. But the way things going, that boy gonna turn her out any day.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Murder.
These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
Please make way, please --
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
C'mere.
What's your story, baby?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Fine as May wine.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Eat lead, coppers.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you got it! You're the boss.
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[I'm on to Juarez.]
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
So where do we begin?
So what do I get in return?
[Everything on the cellphone. We wait for calls. We have no number to call.]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[I told you, non-negotiable.]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
Yes.
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking- Wayne.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
I'll get you up to the border. Friend of mine'll take you in to San Diego. Drop you right at the hospital.
Yes or no?
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Why not?
No.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
No, that was in Columbia.
I dropped her at home.
Still not a question.
Dyslexic?
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
It's Creasy.
Do you know what she told me last night?
I know! I just had to let one go because I couldn't afford him!
For a year?
[No. Why?]
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
This is Mr. Creasy.
You do?
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
Hmm?
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
[Is that good or bad?]
[He's the man, 'the Boss?' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. We had to inject the whole Barrio. We bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
And they took that away.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
What?
Yeah, sure.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
We just talked.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
Well, it ain't your baby.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
I really should get home...
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
You gotta good heart.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Marty...
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
Oh, Marty, thanks a lot. That really takes a load offa my mind.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
I'm gonna see you tonight...
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Oh shaddup, will you do me a favor?
Waddaya talking about?!!
He'll live if that's what you mean. But somebody better be around when he comes to and finds out there's nothing left between his legs.
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
No.  Or why you should.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Look at that right eye.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
Good, because we got a fine old American custom we want to teach you. You know what these are?
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
Same general idea.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
We been had.
The chest-cutter.
Sixteen times.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
Get out the scotch, Ho-Jon.  Don't mention the sex thing unless he brings it up.
This time he did it to a kid who's simple enough to believe him. Why don't you dump the mother, Henry? He creates more work than he gets done.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
I worked with Spearchucker my first month over here, at the 72nd Evac in Taegu. Most of the colored guys know who he is but they're not talking because he asked them not to.
Same here. You can retire my number.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
A football game?
What?
You betcher ass, General.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
Now we're working out a schedule of the outfits we're going to play this year. We all chip into a pool and make bets.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
He's Trapper John! Only man in history who ever found fulfillment in the ladies' can of a Boston and Maine Railroad car! When the Conductor caught him in there with his Winter Carnival date, she screamed: 'He trapped me!' What have you been doing since those days, Trapper?
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
'Course it isn't, but how many chances do we get to go to Japan? With our golf clubs.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
Oh, Jesus.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
That don't surprise me. If you're a good observer, you must have observed by now that Frank Burns is a jerk.
No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
I didn't mean with me.
Excuse me, Sergeant.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
That's about the only thing I don't do  that I'm built for. I inspect the girls and take care of some of the kids in the hospital. Sometimes I tend bar and act as bouncer.
Poker sounds great. When do you play?
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
There's only one worth noticing.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
Now I'll have to wait at least a week. If I announced it tomorrow, after what our new Chief Nurse saw this afternoon, they'd hear her yelling from Seoul to Washington.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
It's the only way we can make enough to put Ho-Jon through Androscoggin.
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
I'm afraid so, Colonel.
Morning, Captain.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
What's that, Henry?
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
May I have the surgeon's name, please?
I been out of action since I got over here five months ago.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
No.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
About me?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Yes, sir.
How do you do.
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
No, no, nothat's your seat.
Mr. D. B. Norton!
All set, Ann?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
You bet I will, Ma.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
There is no letter.
There is no letter. I made it up.
A deal?
Plus a bonus.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Oh!
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Oh, let me go, will you!
Where is she?
Did you find her?
Beany!
What?
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
. . . Tubby?
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Sure. Mostly often.
It must be some kind of a gag.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
You betcha.
Yeah, you bet!
Well?
Whyuh
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
No, I didn't.
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Feller runs the Chronicle .  Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you.
Okay.
Shh!
You're my hero.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
What happened, Mike.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Then where's my FUCKING car!
I what?
What's the suspect's name?
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Yep.
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
Only at the very end.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
National Marksman Competition.
It was okay.
Why? You like my ass?
She grow up in Livingtston, too?
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
Okay, stop.
To run late!
He'll be running at the quarter pole.
He's cutting down the visibility.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
Mmm, needs a little something.
And you think he'll...
Come on. Stay up there, Cozy Girl...
What?
Your concern is heartwarming.
What kind of appreciation are we talking about?
Okay, I think I could swing that.
Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
What happened to your Trans Am?
About what?
Yes.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Wake up?!
Yes.
It's not real.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
Unfinished business.
The weather.
Someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
-- He won't.
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
You've got the keys, send someone in --
What?
It's not used for anything.
Why would I do that?
Way you kiss me.
Sorry?!
This.  No point to it.
There?
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
-- Standard.
Speed?
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
Ah... sure.
Yeah, right.
I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
... Let's take a look over there.
Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!!
This guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
Ryan's Comet!!
GIVE IT EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
There's enough for everybody!
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
You want me to place a few calls?
You forgot to say 'Simon says."
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky!
I ain't no fuckin' kike!
You've got the public upset, Al.
Awwh, Charlie.
Poor, yeah.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
Not another word.
Why should I be?
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
Can't we get a couple whores over?
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
For being a bootlegger?
I was calling yesterday.
I needed to see you again.
It's a mask.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
Gives us something in common.
You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
It always is.
It'll all be over tomorrow. No more wars. No more killin'. Just livin' normal like everybody else.  You'll be stuck with me for good.
I do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. Be the fuckin' Boss of all the other Bosses, but we are gonna be our own Bosses.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
I'm gettin' married in six weeks. I'll already be in Atlantic City which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
Who?
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
They don't give a shit about us!
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Whatta ya mean, Boss?
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
Joe Profaci. Carlo Gambino. Vinnie Mangano. Joe Bananas. They all gotta die.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
I've got friends.
What about the share.
I got partners.
I found that out.
You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
No matter what you say to me Salvatore, you are my bambino.
We were overdue to get hit.
We can operate around these guys.
Let 'em kill each other off! Why should we care?
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
That a Jew compliment?
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
Switch hands.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
I didn't say anything.
<u>Why</u>??
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
Tell me what?
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
What's the "bad" part?
I don't think so.
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
I don't <u>know</u>.
What?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Aaron?
I'm sorry.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
And where is she?
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Thanks very much, sonny--
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
Never.
Looks like it, but--
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
Hey--you're into me for a buck already. I say--McGann. Shoot the whole dollar.
Would you settle for a husband?
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
You got worms.
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
My friends?
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
I apologize.
Yeah.
Good idea. When?
Well, let's get going.
What?
What?
Take me home, Diz.
Why me?
He's a house-afire!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Nonsense.
No wonder--without your dinner.
Y-yes, Jim.
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Ma! Hold him!
The--head?
Emma! Will you *please*--?
Emma!
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
I beg your pardon?
When Jeff gets through with Taylor--  Quiet! What do you mean by breaking in here--? Get out! Get *out* of here!
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
Will he yield for a question?
Will he *yield*?
The gentleman has said repeatedly that he is speaking to the people of his State. He has been waiting, as he so fancifully puts it, for them to come marching here in droves. Would the gentleman be interested in knowing what those people have to say?
What?
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Punch?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
And with your help--
How?
Why?
Some committee's got it.
We're over in the House.
Yes, Senator--*twice*.
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
Go right ahead.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
No! Stop it!
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or *outta* West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Must have been tickled pink.
Second drawer.
Not another bill?
Don't mention it--
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
"So help me God."
Yes, sir--
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Go away, Nosey.
Well, well!
Okay. See you here.
No?
Oh, now--that won't do--
You see--Governor Hopper made an appointment in this case that--well, Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the work, let's say. He's here to see monuments--and pass the time. That's important to--to my work--and everybody concerned. So, someone who can be trusted has to occupy him and keep him out of trouble--
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
Jim, you don't have to--
Just a minute, Joe!
No--I--I'll take a walk-- 
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Who's that?
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Sometimes twice.
Yes, you own it.
Yes, indeedy.
No!
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
I enjoy it.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
What did they say?
Uh-huh.
It's wonderful.
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
Oh, that
Nothing
You have?
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
Yes, of course.
No. It's nothing.
Don't be ridiculous.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Yeah, then what?
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
Had the boys follow us.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
I tell you that dame's nuts.
Hurry up!
John
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
Yes, sir.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Let me go!
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
This is outrageous!
See you later, kid.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
All set.
Yes.
How do you do.
All right.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to
No, thank you.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Why should you?
Nah.
Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
What're you talking about?
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Arthur wants to quit!
They can have the Estate.
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
Oh. That.
You mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
Take the stand!
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
I don't know.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
South Dakota - but on the top.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
I did what!
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
What happened?
You must have been concerned.
No, Dr. Delbanco, it is I who am sorry. Sorry to have wasted your time with such...
Right now?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
How do you mean?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
I don't want to hear any more today.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Go to hell.
What?!
Now we're back on track.
You are so mean.
There's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I'm embarrassed to have --
My pleasure.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
What do you think's wrong with her?
I do.
I'm sorry, your honor.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
My patient had to leave early.
Oh, I don't know...
Lily, I don't think even you could know that --
...And?
Why do you watch?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Okay.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
You're good.
I'm trying.
Is she a friend of yours?
Martin.
Insane! Didn't ja hear? My family got five hundred times better.  Let's go, Vanessa.
Why don't you tell me?
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
Something's bothering her.
So the headaches may not even be a part of this?
Is that like a party trick?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter.
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Okay...
Hello.
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
Uh-huh.
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Uh-huh.
I wondered what happened to her...
You don't think I'm insane?
It's not?
Who'd you go with?  That's not good.
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
I'm honored.
You're completely reliable.
Yes, yes it does...
I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
None of the above, thank you.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
What is he doing here?
What did you do to him!?
He said... he was just looking for a good time.
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Proceed!
I just decked your brother
Are you sure?
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
FINE.
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
Did you ever see him eat?
What's it look like!?
Awfully.
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.
That's one of the plagues, right? The grasshopper plague!
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
I know you did.
Really?
Do it, big boy!
I'm the Bowler.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
I thought you'd never ask.
Half a Dirty Dozen!
He's dead.
Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that sort of covers --
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Captain who?
You're nuts.
Why not?
Date?
That was easy. 
Why?
Monica, where are you?
He's a psycho! He'll kill you!
Yes.
I know I haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
Good or evil, what's the difference?
He is in love. His anger is gone.
We had an off night, that's all.
Because that's what it is.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
Are you coming or not?
So you're chicken?
Shhh.
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of the night!
Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. In his case, it's entirely emotional.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.
Are you sure he's still alive?
But how do we get in?
With or without him, we gotta go!
Through there!
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
I think it's absolutely charming.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
May I come to the map?
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
Fair enough.
I'm not insulted.
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
And where is Joseph?
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
Come in.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
A glass of champagne, please.
Four o'clock.
The first reports came in at about ten.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
Oh?
This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons.  I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
Would you like some brandy?
I'll have the fire built up.
Would you like to take me there, so that we can get warm, sir?
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Not even the slightest hint of something?
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
You must not act impetuously.
But you can do the same thing in six months.  The next few weeks may be the most important ones in your life.
Well, you shall see.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Not in the least.  After all, what is adultery -- only a brief transaction on a couch, requiring a few minutes of privacy.
What are you doing in there?
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
It's me.
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
I gave it to Berthier... this afternoon.
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
Certainly.
What are you talking about?
Yes, I wrote it.
If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
Yes, I do -- very much.
Oh, my dearest child -- you must not worry about anything.  I will teach you everything that you must know.
I very seriously doubt it.  I don't think there is any possibility of making peace with England so long as she sees herself safe from invasion. That is why we must increase the pressure on her economy.  With Russia in the Continental Blockade, England must collapse.  More than 40% of her trade is with the Continent and Russia.
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
Monsieur Varlac, I will count slowly to five, and if you have not begun to get down from the cart by then, I will carry out your execution, on the spot.
Yes, sir.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
With his army of 400,000 men in concealed bivouacs, on a ten mile front, in the forests, bordering the banks of the Vistula river, Napoleon conducted a last minute personal reconnaissance, disguised in the uniform of a Polish lancer.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
And I can go free?
Naw, it ain't like that.
Yeah.
You paid cash?
I'm his cousin.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Thanks for reminding me.
I know, be still.
I can't taste nothing.
That's the sister.
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Damn...how much money ya'll got left from the lottery?
Still gonna smell it.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
Me too.
No, man, just wait.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Ya'll making me look like a punk.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Yeah, pops!
Nice to meet you?
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go home.
And some rolling papers.
He's a boy, dude.
20 minutes?
Joker, a man like yourself can do a lot for this community.  By letting us go, you can improve black and brown relations.
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
That ain't gonna work.
I don't know, I didn't leave you no damn message!
Shut yo' ass up.
The skills are still intact.  Now tie his ass up, Elroy.
Oooh, ba-by!
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
What's he doing here?
That's my girl.
Sorry.
Oh, yeah?
I...
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
The gun...
That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
That's right. That gives you...
You know what I'm gonna do.
Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
No! You can't! They're in on it.
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
Nods.
Over and out.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
What are you going to do?
I don't know.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
Everybody does?
You're a big girl, huh?
Why?
Yeah.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
'Daddy has to go now.
What gives?
No.
Hm!
Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
You, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
Dad, you're bleeding...
Yes, Dad.
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
She went.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Icey, I don't want a husband.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
There's something else.
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
You better not sing that song.
Hm?
John! Don't!
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Why?
Hush, Pearl. Come on.
John, where are we g --
She talks to herself.
Up river.
A feller can't just go around with run-down, busted watches.
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Yonder.
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
Will you buy me a choclit sody?
I'm through, Harry.
My flesh and blood!
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
Didn't you hear me, boy?
Not this time! It was just one youngin -- a little boy babe. And do you know who he was, children?
What you been up to?
Pearl and John.
Look, I know it's been frightening, I know your dreams have seemed real. But... it's okay. Okay?
Thank God.
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
Uh-oh...
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Hi.
Who?
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
You got a sane explanation for what he did?
Just want to talk to him a second.
It so happens I work here, and there's an unsolved murder. I don't like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? You're supposed to be getting some sleep.
Sure, but...
Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
I don't mean her --
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
School.
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Nancy!
Go on...
I mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. But invisible razors. She just... opened up...
Really. Turn 'er up a little.
Rod and I are done. He's too much of a maniac.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
No more fights.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
An omelet.
What was it like?
Evening gown?
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
Just for the honeymoon.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
Possibly.
Or it might be the firing squad!
...des raisins de Madre, des framboises... 
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
How many families live here with you?
No, no.
Monsieur.
Which part of the room is mine?
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
I think I need my glasses.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Shall I draw your bath, sir?
Well, sir, if you should do it again, which I hope you won't, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
No, sir.
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Yes.
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
It is Thursday!
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Razinin.
A cow?
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
No, thank you.
We did our best, Comrade.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
What?
You might hold this for me.
I'll try.
Go ahead.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Ni-notchka.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
Then how did you get here?
No.
I don't think so.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  To us, Ninotchka!
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Comrades! Good people of France!
Yes... a little white house.
Much happier.
Let's turn on the radio.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
What does he say?
No.
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
Do you expect me to believe that?
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Madame, if you...
I must insist that you leave.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
Go on.
What do you want?
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
That also is a question of food, madame. I'll bring you a nice little lunch  la Pre Mathieu. 
Where do you eat?
Where is that?
My jewels?!
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
No, we have nothing to hide.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
He left his White House phone number in his hotel room.
He wants money.
No ... I can do this because I've spent my whole career building anti Communist credentials.
Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
... go on.
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
And if I stay?
How do you see this?
I know it well, sir.
It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
That fruitcake!  What about him?
Definitely.  Colson had him trying to break into Bremer's apartment after Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern campaign literature.
"National Priority."
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
How is this national security?
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
Don't forget, the most important thing in your life is your relationship with your Maker ...  Don't forget to be on God's side.
Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
Sir ... six bodies.
Yes, Mother ...
I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
Thou must.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
My friends call me "Mister President."
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Yes ...
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
He's lying, Clyde.  Always has. That's why Nixon's always been useful. Hold still.  And take your hand off your hip.
Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's giving me a headache ... You may go, Joaquin.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
It won't.  As long as I'm here.
Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.  It keeps me calm.  I don't like going back into the same building four times.
That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
But they all got it back again, didn't they?  We should have lunch sometime.
No one understands! -- even my own men.  What do you think the Communists respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt, soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV crying?  Hell no!  I understand the Communist mind, I've studied it for thirty years.  They grasp "realpolitik" better than any of us, right, Henry?
We have to entertain the possibility ...
Yeah ...
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
Free, if you're the president.
... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John.  The question is: How do we screw Ellsberg so bad it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
You remember, John, in '48 -- no one believed Alger Hiss was a communist. Except me.  They loved Hiss just like they loved this Ellsberg character. East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
Hello ...
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
I like jazz ...
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Sir?
Yes, yes.
No, sir ...
... and get rid of all these "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!
Not that.  Us.
I want a divorce.
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
Then I'll be there for you.
Will you ... would you kiss me?
Thank you.
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
I deduced it. Once you walked in.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
You don't know what he thinks.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
Try "old" on for size.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
You sure?
You figure him for a dope runner?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
I never do.
Well I didn't see it.
At the gettin' place.
No. I found it.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Hey.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
I know where it's going to be.
Where does he work?
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Step out of the car please, sir.
Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all.
I don't know. Will there?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
What time do you close?
Now is not a time. What time do you close.
You live in that house behind the store?
Call it?
No.
Uh-huh.
Never mind.  I want a tent.
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
Okay.
No sir, it's unusual.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Okay. We can stop that.
Yes?
The what?
I'm just one person. Don't matter the size of the bed.
You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty.  It ain't took.
That's got two double beds.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
Not any way.
I'm retired.
I didn't say braze.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
I don't know.
Yes sir. Two tours.
Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Yeah?
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
No, I didn't have to.
That's a nice name for what you need...
Little place called "Williams," why?
I know plenty.
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
YOU shut up!  They're beautiful, but get them some water.
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
"Banners?"
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
...to see you.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
I'm sorry.
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
I better go check on them.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Are you and Larry happy?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
What happened when you were twelve?
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
What?
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
I'd slap his face.
Los Angeles, California.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
You made out alright.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
...did I win some contest?
I came for love. My fianc is here.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
Where are you going?
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
Fine. You got five...
Of what?
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
My socks?
Beer, please.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
What 'look'?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
So what the fuck's a Finn?
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay?  "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
What?
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
What do you mean?
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
Uh-huh.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
David Ravell.
She's a lesbian.
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
How ya been, Wash? Been what, twelve, thirteen year'n?
Gopher, Everett?
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
Fire! I hate fire!
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
Four hundred, Delmar.
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Not that I'm aware.
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Okay, Pappy.
In any state.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
...Why you... lyin,... unconstant... succubus!
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
That's right, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
Aw, that's all right.
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
But... but...
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress. No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state...
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir!
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Nobody. It just came to me.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push.  Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
No, sir!
Not exactly, sir.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Yes, sir!
I called you Sarge.
No, sir.
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
He was. He died.
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Yeah... Mmmm...
You hope.
No way... Would you?
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
My kinda group!
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I know who you are and what you want.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
It sure was.
God.
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Your real father?
Twenty-two years ago.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
I know that.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Yeah. All week long.
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
Sure.
Naw.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
But it can't wait.
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Yeah.  Yeah, I got an idea.  I gotta check something.
Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
You finish.  Then we finish.
Hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
What about us?  What if she has a gun?
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Pure idiot.
Shit!
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
We'd like to come in.
Huh?
He's talking about Bernard Pearlstine.
I said open the door.
It's okay, Raoul.
No fucking way.
Nobody leaves.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
Open the door.
0150.
Wait.
They're coming in here, aren't they?
Little bit.  Yeah.
Don't though. 
I don't know, why?
I am.  I'm here.
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
He won't even know who it was.
Stop it.
What?!? Don't tell me you're buying this?
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
They mean, Pig!, that the Black Panther Party declares that if you try to brutalize our community or take our weapons.  We are going to shoot you!!!
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
I don't know. Look around man.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
And did you witness the shoot-out?
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Not good enough Rodgers. Not good enough at all. Black terrorists on the floor of a State Capitol. I will not say this again, these Negro Commies are to be stopped and now. You tear them down. Either from the outside or the inside.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
So what's the deal?
Yeah... let me think about it.
Right on Brother Judge...
Brimmer.
Yeah.
And who is we?
Maybe...
He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
If you got something to say, say it.
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
All of the above, man...  And then some.
What?
Where is he?.
Why didn't you tell me?
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Late summer.
You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
You got me beat on both accounts.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Thank you.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
I'll leave in the morning with Gabriel.
Very well, then.
Lovely.
Yes, sir.
Apology accepted.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
Very well, proceed, sir.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
I consider them linked.
You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
Probably.
I understand, sir.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Yes.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Where?
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
Please.
It's Mister Marion.
Balderdash!
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
Thank you.
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Worse.
No, he won't.  There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis. First, he is a very proud man, He would rather risk defeat than share a victory.  If you give him what he thinks is an out, he'll take it.
But father, they might come this way.
Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
I will. Come and kiss me.
For a little while.
Yes.
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
I swear.
Allman Brothers.
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
I think it is so, Ellie.
Then come on.
Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
You're telling me.
Why? For God's sake, why?
Because it's right.
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
This babe has said enough.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
It's beautiful!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
Aye, aye, sir!
She.  Goes.  Free.
Elizabeth goes free!
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
I'll torture it out of you.
Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor.
What're you suggesting?
Men!  Are you up for it?
Aye, for us there is.
Remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
I want you to leave.  And never come back.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Then why aren't you eating?
Commodore, you can't do that!
Ceremony?
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
Me!
No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
Exactly.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
I said, no lies.
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
By remembering that I serve others, not only myself.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Agreed!
We need to go!
I haven't set foot off dry land since I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded.  It's been a sound policy.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
'Bootstrap?'
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Barbossa.
I'll lead them away.
My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner.  His blood runs in my veins.  You need my blood.  And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!
Yes.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
And no lies!
He's not telling the truth.
My apologies, Governor.
Speak.
No.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
If you'd like, we can go straight to the authorities.  I understand they are very interested in talking to you.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Why are there two ottomans?
Okay, arms up, lean forward.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
The trunk.
Shut up and do it!
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
Look, asshole, I don't got time for this.  If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
Dr. Argon would say we are all prisoners.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
Who isn't?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
That's what I thought.
Yeah, we'll see.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
All I'm saying is that the companies that have money for the kind of research you're interested in, have money because that's what they're interested in!  Money!
You're insane.
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
The nanobot.
Yes.
We don't?
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
You're the doctor.
What?  What's wrong?
Blame the victim.
This is what I deserve for trying to protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Probably the caffeine.
No problem.
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
Did you think I could just leave you...?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
Pipe down, brain lady!  And you...
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
No? Why not?
Certainly. Right over there.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Of course I am Stewart.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
I poisoned him.
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
I see.
Your house?
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
You're the Tribune man?
Well, I should say!
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Yeah?
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Yes, sir.
A what?
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Siberian bloodhound?  No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
No!
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
It's the smoke.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Right!
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Very good.
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
You don't.
I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate is ready.
I have. Double-strength!
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
The name is Smythe.
Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
Yes, sir.
I just putter.
A bird in a gilded cage?
That's all I wanted to know!
It doesn't matter.
It can't be possible.
In my handbag.
Sure.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
... It's a pretty short trip.
Bud brought it to me.
Here's my favorite.
I've got to go ...
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
Oh, George ...
No I'm not sweetie.
Um ... It's ...
Really Biff? The keenest?
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
What are you doing?
What?
She won't go out with me?
Gee whizz, Bud. Guess I'll just have the usual. Cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
"Changes."
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Yes I did.
Very well ...
The basketball team?
Oh sure it is.
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Get lost!
I don't know.
Well, yeah. I'm ... Bud Parker and you're ... um--Mary Sue.
Biff Martin. Captain of the basketball team.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
The pages filled in?
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
Remember when you told me that Lisa Rosenberg liked me?
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Wow.
You don't know?
We'll just put up the top.
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Nice ... Nice ...
What the hell's going on!
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Oh--well ...
What do I MEAN!  You think this is a toy? You think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
I didn't do anything wrong.
I'm going to leave now.
I don't know ... Three, four weeks.
Oh sure. For the first hundred years. Then it starts to get a little monotonous.  Sleep well.
... Yeah.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
I brought you something ... From the library.
I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do ...
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
What happened?
Yeah. 
So you can't talk to me?
And what was this?
This is "Fly With Us?"
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Hello everyone.
I feel really on the spot now.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
Hi, is this Jack?
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Are you watching a porno movie?
Yeah....you're married aren't you, Jack?
...yeah.....
It's ok that I'm calling, right, I mean? It's ok.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah. It's so hard these days and I really need it.
I thought you had your own business. You said you were gonna diversify and all that stuff....
I know I did. But I don't.
I didn't lie.
I don't know.
Not very well.
Thank you.
Ok.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
It's terrible, no.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
It's Barry.
No, no. I did.
Yeah?
This is Lena.
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
...I don't know what you mean....
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
This is funny.
This is nice.
You left me at the hospital.
For what?
Ok, bye, bye.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
I know.
Sorry.
Can I ask how much is this?
Barry Egan.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
I think you have a call?
That was weird. I meant good.
Like a psychiatrist?
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
Yes I'm fine.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Ok.
Hi.
What is this, man?
Right now, you're doing nothing?
You can't be late.
Seriously.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'll see you there.
I want you to go right away, I think that's best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy is selling.
I'm only paying two of you guys.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
You ready?
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
No.
It's fine.
Once or twice.
I think she's sweet on him, that's what I think.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
By whom? The Marquis?
You'll hate me now, won't you?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
That's enough.
His rug.
Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
Why was it you never took her by force?
A few indiscretions in his youth.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
Do you favor its publication?
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
No. It most certainly was not.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
Poorly.
Sweet, then? Like the pastry?
Such gallantry in men is -- sadly -- a rarity; How lucky I am to receive his charity!
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
Is it awfully violent?
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
Oh, but I am!
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
Forgive me, I beg you --
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
But it's just begun --
Very much.
Am I?
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
I can't
Sure
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
So I've been told.
I'll remember that.
Don't
Nothing for you to worry about, darling
I wanted it
You will not walk out on me
How so?
He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
He personally asked you to?
Uh-huh
Like a bug.
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
Who the hell's Manolete?
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Okay, boy wonder, what?
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
But it's not a great syllable
I don't care.
What does this have to do with--?
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
The ad..
"Do what you can"?! That's not good enough I
I don't want to sit
So, on to the Life Of Christ!
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
How can he embarrass you?
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
Whadda ya mean?
I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
Does that mean...
At night?
How many pounds I gotta lose?
I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
It feels real good.
That's all right. He don't mind.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Oh, Jake.
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Yeah.
Yeah, what?
Positive.
Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
I am answering...
You did?
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
Yeah --
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
I'm leaving you Jake.
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Jake, sit down for a minute.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
Excuse me for living.
Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
Jefferies?
Well, officer -- do your duty.
Thanks.
Ever get an answer?
Oh -- I almost forgot!
You think he's getting out of here?
You figured that out, huh?
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
I told you that --
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
You're too valuable to the magazine for us to play around with. I'll send Morgan or Lambert.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Gunnison?
It's me.
Who are you?
Well, I only quote from the best.
You've got a hormone deficiency.
I don't want to.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Uh-huh.
Police?
Would four of them -- ?
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Mrs. Doyle?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
That's good news.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
For what?
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
Don't you see how silly you're being?
What's the apartment house number?
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
What about it?
It doesn't make sense to me.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
Inside stuff?
Still -- those witnesses.
That's a suitcase?
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
Phone number?
Two minutes.
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
Know the Millertown bluff?
Stay there.
Jim Stark.
No--
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
I was in it.
Well--
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
Really, Frank?  When was that?
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Open it.
No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
Do you hear from him, son?
Plato.
Head-shrinker?
I'll wait for him.
What?
I just don't want trouble.
I saw it.  Gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  Do you think it never stops?
Who knows.  Plato?
I hitched.
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
We know.
I'm here.  Shut up.
Wowee ow wow!  Let's take it for the summer.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Who?
I'm here.
I'm fine.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
What do you think?
Just a guard.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
Mom--I'm not--
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Where what was.
You going there?
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
No.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
See, we're very modern.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
Hi.
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
It's all right.
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
I'll never get close to anybody.
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
What?
Gabriel -- !
Gabriel!
Don't hurt him...
Please, Gabriel, don't...
YES!!!
NO!
To all those cons...
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Radio said.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
What.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
Nick, I love you --
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Jack. Jack Bangs.
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
Nick, the ice is --
I'm almost done.
You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
They all are. Football's on.
Who wouldn't.
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
Bam Bam.
No. It's her brother.
We got faith in you, Nick Mason.  You're our inside man.
And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
I said, who the hell made the map?
When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh...  ...the Powwow Safe.
What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
Get out.
Don't tip.
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
I'm no threat without a gun.
Take 'em.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
Mr. Bangs.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms.
I promise you, I didn't know!
Ain't there yet.
Not yet.
I'm just saying.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Thought you hate your old man.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
There is no other table --
I'M NOT NICK!
Since when? What the hell is this room?
They changed the layout.
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
Elois?
Bullshit.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
What? Snap out of it!
Chew? Toby Chew? No.
Why am I Mr. Pink?
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
What do you care?
Give me my book.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Juicy, junior, real juicy.
Like hell I am.
Don't ask me that.
Mr. Pink.
He don't believe in it.
You do?
Shit. I don't remember that at all.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
We think we got a rat in the house.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
That's your excuse for going on a kill crazy rampage?
Joe.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
Lie back down, and try to -
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Fuck all that.
Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
That's not correct.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
Where?
I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
For all I know, you're the rat.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
We don't think this place is safe.
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
This is what he was doin'.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Yeah, those guys too.
Maybe he did.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
Look of things, she doesn't.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
His letters will keep.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
Thanks.
Go on. Tell me more about her.
Will she be dark or fair?
That's fine.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
All right -- it's said!
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
I'm sorry.
It's going to Sonora.
Maybe they will.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
To the other side of the street.
So did I. They were in it.
Yes.
All right. I'll tell you.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
That's right, Steve.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Finished, son?
I don't care what she asked you.
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
All right, you didn't know.
I said I didn't care.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Just a thing I was workin' on.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
He certainly could. About a month.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
No. We're not stayin' --
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
And you've got me all figured out?
Thanks, Steve.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Hey, I have an idea...
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's great, isn't it. I think it's so cool... have a girl as a friend.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
Hugh Kane.
That we should take our friendship a little further?
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
Oh, Buddy, I've never had someone be so protective of me!
I think so.
I don't know. He was right behind me a minute ago.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Aww, you ain't that bad. You just need a little flava. First thing we gotta do is get you some new gear.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Yeah, I didn't know what else to do.
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Theo, did you see the animal?
Willing? I like that.  And, this one?
How are we going to get them all up there?
Are you sure it's not the tape?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
What is it, Dwight?
Hi.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Get out?! What does it say?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
You don't think...
Carl can't believe how much I make at swap meets.
No! Stop it! It's not funny. Mom might do it!  Someone else might die.
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Looks good, Mom!
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
This is so silly. 
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
I certainly did.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
PUSSY-willows, Dottie!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
I certainly was not!
Yes, I was.
I... I'm not sure...  ...I... oohhh... Excuse me...
You'll pay for this, Marvin A. Pickles!  I'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  The prosecution rests, your honor.
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Watch the booth! I'll be back! 
Yes, I did. It's terrifying! The police were at my house this morning.
I'm not that bad a driver.  Look at her hair!  Turn it off, honey.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
...Browsing.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Right here!
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Yes you are.
I didn't hear anything. Got any dessert?
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
Sure I do.
You can?
No.
I'd like to get out of here.
You could go and open the door.
But I like teaching school.
I did her hair.
She showed me a drawing.
Yes.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Why?
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting  I feel as if I'd never known her.
Weren't you afraid?
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked you to amuse us.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
I won't get lonely.
Yes.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I have something even better.
I can imagine.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
I keep telling myself that.
I'm a good boy, but no one listens to what I say.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
I should like people to read what I've written.
Perhaps
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez - this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
Unless what?
That's too bad.
This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.
Giacomo -- la bellisslina madonna -
She's not been here for a long time.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
Of course.
Please.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Oh, no problem. It can wait.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Nine years.
Impotent.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
I believe in it for some people. I mean, for me it was silly, I was confused going in. So I just formed my own personal theory that you should never take advice from someone of the opposite sex that doesn't know you intimately.
Basically, yes.
Ann. Hello.
Nothing I can't finish later.
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
What kind of personal project?
Yes.
Yes.
Then do it.
Absolutely not.
Yes.
At some level, I don't understand your nervousness. Have you decided to leave John?
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
Yes.
Yes.
So you have had sex.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
What was the problem?
So you lied to her?
And now you can?
God, I m so mad at him!!
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
I don't know. Possibly.
Mmmmm...
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
Yes.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
So it was recently that you tried this.
Radon leakage?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Yes.
Yes.
Not really.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Why, so you can go after him?
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Let me talk to him first.
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Why did you do that?
You are in trouble.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
You are in serious trouble.
I don't want to discuss it.
It looks like a tablecloth.
Well. I can't stay.
Bye.
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
Why don't you let me tape you?
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Yes.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Very much live.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
Okay.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Could be risky.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Oh.  Well, when, then?
Look, I'll call you, okay?
What's so stupid about it?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
You told Ann about this?
I just... Ann is very...
You trust him.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
Graham.
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
How about for five hundred?
Really. How'd it go?
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Sure.
I knew the man, Emil Hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. I saw the girl around the building but I didn't know her. She never came to the clinic.
Mm? OK. Be with you in a sec.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
No? How come?
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT
Good!  I'm gonna be there.
Fools!
What's cookin', Bert?
He needs help.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Everything's free there.
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
You're practically naked!
Me?
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Farley!
Flavors!
Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
YOU'RE NO GOOD
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
CRIMINAL
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help Janet freshen up before rehearsal.
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
We love you, Baby.
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
It'll just take a second.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Huh.
Yeah, I'm here.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
I can't help the traffic.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
I'd rather have a knife.
I'm working on it.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
I told you. Filet and salmon.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
When do we get to drink it?
Whoa.
Then it's a good thing.
Shut up.
So what's the plan today?
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
I want to go home now.
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
I'm a quick learner.
Well, she is cute.
Okay! Fuck!
I'm fine!
We were supposed to play golf.
Count me out.
I will.  See ya!
What?
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy.  This is our day!
Can you give me some room here?
You're an asshole.
Nope.
Shut up.
What's happening?
It's private.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
I know what you need.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
Yeah.
What?
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
I'm fine. You rest.
You need a new car anyway.
Sure.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Yeah. Thanks.
A paper?
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
Like what a fraud he was.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
What rehearsal dinner?
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
So how're you doing?
He had to make a phone call.
Where?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I hope that girls knows how lucky she is, marrying no less than Derek Summersby.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
This one?
No dad!
Don't touch him.
You don't even know what that word means.
Boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?
Just make noises then.
I heard.
Yes it was.
Bo, can you turn down the volume until Officer Paski leaves?
I don't want any one of you spending time with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?
We have to go in the basement.
Got it!
It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.  We won Graham.
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
It's old Morgan.
Sounds made up.
Where are we going to sleep?
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
Yeah baby. I think someone did.
No.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Yeah.
No money, eh?
That's why they got you in jail?
What friend is that?
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
She was hurt... pretty bad.  Emmett, they took the little boy with them.
Right.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
This is a brutal land.
I already did that.
In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Ten A.M.
I haven't done anything.
Where's the pinto going?
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
I understand.
Anybody got any ideas?
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
Why?
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
What now?
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
I'm done talking. Get out.
Really?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
Don't press your luck, Carter.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
It's none of your business.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Why would they stop you?
We'll handle that. He's careless.
Hello, Paden. How ya doing?
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Maybe we ought to ask Stella.
This is a lot of money.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
So we understand each other?
If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
I don't know if that's going to happen.
As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
I'll walk you out.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
You really think so?
-- I can explain.
You're so good to protect her like this.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
I do?
Excuse me?  Start?
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
Do what you do to Simone.
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Is that a problem?
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
Clyde.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
You want me to call Security?
I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Why?
If anyone asks about Simone --
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Precisely.
Night, Lainey.
No, that was me.
Me and Simone.  What I did.
What?!
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
-- I bet you have.
Don't you?
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
You're in breach.
Taller, Viktor.
It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing "creative differences".
But that's Simone's part.
She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.
...De profundis clamo ad te domine.
Dr. Crowe.
Congratulations.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
He your best buddy?
You hate him?
Yeah. Sorry.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
No, we're not.
Do you know what 'Yo no quiero morir' is?
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
I definitely won't.
Really?
They want me to do things for them.
...I don't know.
It's our pleasure.
J. C. Penny's?
How'd he know I'd come?
What are you talking about?
Slut.
Which street corner?
...Hi.
Yeah. It's the alternator all right.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
I could. You sucked.
All right. "Fratricide". Minor technical detail.
Metaphysical question, man.
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
"Blood?"
People say he was a murderer.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Amen.
Which means we've got ONE week to start acting like a professional band.
Let it go.
I... heard something... came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
Look. You want to talk about this?
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
Dude's a half--squid. Ain't many places he can hide. Sea World, maybe.
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Whatcha' doin'?
He tried to kill you, Starla.
And this is mine.
A Martian is from Mars, Trevor.
Shelby!
Your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, Wally.
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
What can I do you for?
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
'Praise Jesus?' That's fucking pushing it, Margaret.
How much style?
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Would I lie to you?
I give up.
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Shoot.
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
We lost him.
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
You could've asked.
Like what?
How do you know?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Yeah?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
See ya, Kate.
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
I want you to know I'm doing this against my better instincts.
No.
How'd you know?
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Go.
Redneck heaven.
This is Bandit I, come back.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
What does the old Timex say?
Yeah, guy?
What's your twenty?
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Go head on, breaker.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
And a very bad gamble.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Get a coroner's estimate too.  -- Miss, I've been transferred and I was disconnected. No one is answering and I need someone from security to pick up that line. It's urgent.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
Yeah, m'brothers... They didn't make it.
I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm gonna get laid by some fine ass angels and then go hang out with Jesus and them.
Shit, if you're on a crazy jag, why stop there, why not take Fort Knox with a fucking slingshot or go into Hell after Hitler... I like your chances a lot more.
Then quit acting like somebody shit in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave us fifty grand.
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
Only if you really, truly mean it.
Without peer?
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
We're hot, and they're losing a whole floor's worth of business saying it's "under construction."
I thought Heller was a double op?
His testimony has the potential of blowing the lid off what's left of the La Cosa Nostra is this country. That alone warrants total immunity from prosecution and and a vanishing act with Witness Protection.
-- Your intel corroborates what we already know. Sparazza's health is in rapid decline and before his date with destiny, it seems he wants one last thing... The heart of his sworn enemy. A recently opened, cash rich escrow account has been traced back to Sparazza. This and the mention of this mysterious Swede makes the million dollar contract on Israel very real.
No... We're trying to save Heller.
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
I don't see it like that at all.
Yeah... Sid?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Bag this fucker Buzzy.
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby.  Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
A Fed? Like FBI?
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
Security's locking down the elevators.
What?
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Naw baby, they heard about that Triad hit, the work ya'll put in and they recognize the skills. And this ain't no tryout, tap-dance "show us your shit" thing neither -- if ya'll want this then I'mma go git it for 'ya.
She reappeared exactly as she had before?
Why did you agree to come here?
No, she won't.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
How quickly?
He's dead.
What?
Why, who did you see?
Rheya.
Will she come back?
I wish you'd told me.
I don't know.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What do you mean?
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
I think so.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
No.  I love you.
I love you.
I can't stay here.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
Please.  Don't.
We want to talk freely.
It's an experiment.
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Queens... You know Queens?
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
How did you know?
They're kind of fuzzy.
No kidding.
Could be, I guess.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
Sleep good.
Let go!
Not exactly.
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
"To"... Forget about you.
It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Mike...?
I think it's probably still a good idea.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
Sure we are, let's go!
What?
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
I'll be right up.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?!!
You heard me.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
I'm all right.
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Call a cruiser!
No, I need'm now!
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
No, sir...
Is she injured?
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Mom and I got plans.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting?
I don't think she can sing, either.
Peter Parker, you have no idea what I did this weekend.  Or didn't do. It's no business of yours either way.
At least this ensemble doesn't glow in the dark.
No. No, that's okay.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
You stop him?
No, no.
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
Come on, laughter's the best medicine!
Mm-hmm.
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
Get away from me, freak!
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
Uh-huh. Look, this should be skintight.  Bright colors.  Red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
Thanks, I already ate.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Even if they're not clever.
I hate people with alliterative names.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
Thank God.
Does it have a human name?
I've gotta study.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
I'm here...
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
Why?
So you've found Thorkel?
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
I know him.
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Precise equipment such as waldos
Oh, Peter. A zit.
--but I didn't feel like getting to know your roaches.
Yes.  Do you have a date?
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Power down.  I need to talk to you.
I've had an extremely bad day, Octavius.  A sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
This is the unified field!  All the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Actually, I got this spider bite
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
I'll try. Thanks.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Imagine how I feel.
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
And blow up the universe just to prove he's right?  Bit egotistical, isn't it?
Bonkers.
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Then we shall all zalute Feldwebel von und zu Schulz! About face!
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
Any news on Dunbar?
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
I don't know anymore.
Yeah. Security.
So long, Sefton.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Forget it.
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Sefton!
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
The men here used it for a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily.
Say, Schulz --
Some are not bad at all.
It's a mouse trap.
Let go, Animal! It's roll call! Hitler wants to see you!
Comrade! Comrade! Otchi Tchorniya -- Otchi Tchorniya!
They'll shoot you, Animal!
I don't care if they wear galoshes!
You're teasing me again!
No?
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
What do they always say?
Come on, you little stooge. Hand over them keys.
Yes, sir.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
You did!
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
They know about that gadget. I'd worry more about the radio.
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Give me the radio.
Ich weiss alles.
Ganz einfach... Streichhoelzer... und eine Zigarette...
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
No! No!
Just don't drool on it.
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
I don't know. He bathed, now he is roaming the ship. He must be the only Engineer in Starfleet who does not go to Engineering!
I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
Commander.
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
Agreed.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
I believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.
All of us.
Oh, of course.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
Better?
I hadn't planned on it.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
There's just no way to disrupt a gravimetric field of this magnitude!
Captain, I don't know how much longer I can hold her together!
I was ordered to by the Captain.
Guinan? I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, they're full of great ideas.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
Make it so.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Thank you.
Well, that narrows it to Klingon, Breen or Romulan.
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Dr. Marcus, it's your planet.
What is it?
David!... What went wrong?
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
It would seem that Grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
Logic indicates that is the case.
I have already made one transmission too many...
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Scan for vessels in pursuit!
Aye, sir!
Aye, sir!
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
Saavik... Is... David with you?
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
You would have done the same for me.
The ship... Out of danger...?
Aye, sir, Warp Speed...
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
What about Grissom, Mr. Chekov?
Come on!
Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
No tricks, Kirk. You have one minute.
If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
I will speak with you alone, Kirk.
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Yes...
... Spock...
Yes... But -- how...?
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
Great power... to control... dominate... destroy. If it works.
Success, my lord.
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Peace and quiet appeals to me, Lieutenant.
You know what they say, Lieutenant. Careful what you wish for: you may get it.
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
Spare me your notions of poetry, please. We all have our assigned duties and...
And who am I hiding from?
The inspection will continue once we're underway, Doctor.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
He's BEEN there and hasn't found what he wants. Can you spare someone? There may be people hurt.
How can you think of food at a time like this?
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
Stage One of our experiments was conducted in the labora- tory. Stage Two of the series will be attempted in a lifeless underground; Stage Three will involve the process on a plane- tary scale. What follows is a computer projected simulation of Stage Three. Please watch closely.
I know, I know...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
But we can't just sit here -- !
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
What's the matter -- ?
What do you want with us? I demand --
And I'll wager he never told you about his shipmate, the beautiful and courageous Lieutenant McGiver, who gave up everything to join me in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how <u>Admiral Kirk</u> requited her devotion -- She's dead as earth!
There is some pain at first, I am told, and then the effects are quite benign -- until the end. That was what I learned from watching my wife.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I see. Helmsman?
We appear to have plenty of time.
What?
How soon --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
You knew enough to tell Saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life --
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
Of course. We're one big happy fleet. Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know the Klingon proverb that tells us revenge is a dish that is best served cold?  It is very cold in space.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Rake her.
Inoperative.
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
Aye, sir --
I'm trying, sir. Stand by...
Admiral --
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Yes, SIR.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
The tape was made a year ago. I can only assume they've reached Phase Two by now --
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
Best we could do in two hours.
The ship -- out of danger?
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Permission to speak candidly, sir?
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
Energize defense fields.
Who?
HURRY.
We're finding it.  Please, <u>please</u> -- you've got to give us time -- the bridge is smashed, computers inoperative...
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Stop engines.
<u>I did nothing</u> -- except get caught with my britches down. I must be senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep right on quoting regulations. Meantime, let's find out what the hell is going on and see how bad we've been --
Project parabolic course to avoid entering Neutral Zone.
I'm aware of my responsibilities, Mister.
Aft thrusters, sir.
Ready, sir.
Honors -- hup!
No power to the weapons system, sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Aye, sir.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Gillian --
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
A moment alone, please.
We could learn a thing or two from this flea trap. It has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
It'll come back to him.
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
I liked him better before he died.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
"Guessing" is not in my nature...
We're just -- observing.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Yes, under "U.S. Government." Now we need directions.
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
I'm wery sorry, but --
I'm impressed, Mr. Chekov. A lot of effort for a short voyage.
Most prudent.  Engine room. Report, Scotty.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the Comm channels...?
Shields, aye.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
Well, that's something. I'da let you off right here.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Who do you think I am?
A spaceship with a missing man.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Permission granted.
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
What is our target in time?
What are the variables...?
But you said toxic.
Yes?
Exaggerate.
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Go, Mr. Sulu.
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Picture, Uhura!
283 degrees... 15.2 kilometers...
On screen.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
Humpbacked - people.?
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
Mr. Sulu?
How long, Scotty?
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Don't take too long. We're sitting ducks for their radar systems...  Mr. Sulu, impulse climb.
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
The beasties seem happy to see you, Doctor. I hope you like our little aquarium.
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
Vulcans are well known as the intellectual puppets of the Federation!
Well, that's different.
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
It took us centuries to learn that it doesn't have to take centuries to learn.
I'll be here.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
For what purpose?
Data doesn't breathe.
The artificial lifeform was right?
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
Good. Let's begin to move these people out...
Another time.
Federation support, Federation procedures, Federation rules... look in the mirror, Admiral... the Federation is old... in the last twenty four months, it's been challenged by every major power in the quadrant -- the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion... they all smell the scent of death on the Federation. That's why you've embraced our offer... because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave Captain's valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba'ku, your Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say... need I go on?
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Someone probably said the same thing about the Romulans a century ago.
Do you know how they were damaged?
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
If it works you mean.
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
Worf, what the hell are you doing here?
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
No. We'll be responsible for that, Mister Worf.
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
Why was Data assigned?
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
I'll be fine.  He's a different story.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
I wish to... go back to the way I was.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
No... no, please... you cannot...
And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
What?
Contact Starfleet Command.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off.
Let's go.
How serious is the damage?
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
<U>Engage.</U>
I'm on it...
Active.
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
I can try.
Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
'Fraid not.
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Some.
We have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
I have to...
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Onscreen.
Unless you'd like to stay.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
Agreed. Options?
Right.
We've lost Bridge control!
Nothing.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Mister Worf... find Data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the Borg.
Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
What are you suggesting?
Hold that thought.
Riker here.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
Vulcans sleep lying down...
That's the question -
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Don't remind me.
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
Ah. I believe you also consumed Romulan ale at the officers' mess on the night of question, Doctor?
You say you are due for retirement. May I ask: do your hands shake?
That's a comfort...
Very much.
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Yes.
Well, I -
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
Uhura, monitor!
Who else?
She's only a cog in the wheel - no way she knows that.
Second star to the right - and straight on till morning...
She programmed the torpedo hits?
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
Kill him! He's the one!!
He's got it.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
WHO ELSE...?
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
You hear that?
Sulu!
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
You have personally -
Congratulations, Lieutenant. That must make you very proud...
According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice...
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
Why would they give them to us?
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
Nothing, Captain. If they're here, they're rigger for silent running.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
I don't want to.
Confirmed, Captain!
We are experiencing a technical malfunction. All backup systems inoperative.
What is it?
What's left of it.
I think  not.
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
How do both sides overcome ingrained prejudice?
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
It'll serve you right.
You're working late.
He was a bit proud as I recall.
He turned out all right.
I wish I could believe that, Doctor.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
I can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
Reminds me of a young doctor I used to know...
Not tonight, I have work here.
Yes. And, frankly, I envy them as well. They've made important choices; they're going to have great challenges ahead of them. New worlds to conquer...
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
They are trying to override the access codes. Reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and...
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
Full axis rotation to port! Fire all ventral phasers!
Deanna, stand by.  Open a channel.
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
Do you have a name, sir?
Emergency force fields are holding.
Why is it moving?
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
With pleasure, Captain.
You're speaking of emotional investment?
Aye, sir.
Ready, sir!
The targeting sequence should take about four minutes.
On screen.
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
We can only hope so.
Praetor Shinzon?
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
Yes.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
You're not Reman.
I won't defend my life to you.
We are.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
What about Picard?
Seven minutes.
She is here.
They're holding position.
None.
I don't think so... 
Thank you.
Sure.
Thank you.
They must have picked it up in space.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
It's in a green Mustang?
It's taken on a disguise.
Oh shit!!!
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
This is George Fox...
Watch it. They're coming out.
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
What.
What.
Money.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
I am Jenny Haydn.
Space?
My... husband.
Shit!
I need you.
No.
No.
When we get here.
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
Can I have the gun?
Yes?
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
He will.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Yes. Sing some more.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
Yes.
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
You could have killed us both!!
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Doesn't make sense.
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
No.
It could have been anything.
We better get it into the box. Come on...
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
I saw you play, man.  You were good. Like a fucking freight train I remember saying.  So what happened, injuries or what?
Just not the eyes.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
Watch and see.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Thanks, Max.
Hey, Iris, you okay?
I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time.  Do us both good.  Right?
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
He makes her see her own death, feeds off the reaction... killer and victim merging... orgasm and agony merging.  And he records it all.
Is he dead?
I won't say anything.
This dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'Hey Max why you following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you a drink and explain.' And she says...
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
She never gave me a tape.
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Your sex life?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Let's talk in the car.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
She still loves me.
She's my destiny.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
So that gives you something.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot tub on my birthday.  I'm going to really miss it.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
Just Lenny.
Are you going to make me beg?
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
You're thinking...?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
Mam, it's my truck. I know my own capacity.
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
Yes.
He had an orange hat on.
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you up.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
"Gone live?"
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
He's a consultant to a network TV program on Profilers. He gets a check every episode.
I know.
We're trying to match them with dump site bodies.  This we know is Carol Delview from Tampa, found her last Spring. This one --
You did.
What's that?
I found a peephole into Deviant World. I'm gonna reach in and yank some of those creeps out.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
Slow down a second, you met with Low --
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
Mack, I'm just trying to keep up with now.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
I'm going to Amarillo.
No weapon.
I'll be back.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
He's moved on to TV.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
You knew it was me all along?
Maybe you should back off.
Yeah.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
The same.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
You're money, baby.
What kind of car do you drive?
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
You're a comedian?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Tell me about it...
What what? What advantages?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Yes. I mean, no. I mean, maybe he would find her, I mean you attractive. Maybe he doesn't like to dance. Maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who don't dance either...
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
What else is going on?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
...And she's with someone else.
Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
Why not?
I understand.
Listen. I had a great time.
Yeah. And an actor.
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
...The red piece of shit over there...
...get the hell outta here already...
Hi, Mike?
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
I thought you met someone else.
You don't call.
Oh no?
I do. Good for you, man.
...That's probably a more appropriate analogy.
Classy.
Bud.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
Well, let's hit that party.
Don't sweat it. Now I got an L.A. gun story. You should hear the way I tell to the guys back home. He had an Uzi. Mike half-smiles.
I didn't make it...
She didn't like me... I made a fool of myself...
She's really special, guys.
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all... 
Wow, I guess you were home... 
Sorry. We got knocked out pretty quickly.
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
Hang on, Voltaire.
S'up Trent?
When?
Whu?
Did she, or did she not smile?
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
You think they're watching?
Let's go.
I know she's coming back.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
Respect, my ass. They respect honesty. You see how they dress when they go out? They want to be noticed. You're just showing them it's working. You gotta get off this respect kick, baby. There ain't nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.
Hello, Lisa. I'm Trent. What a lovely makeup job.
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
What? That was the best part of the old game.
Yeah. You met him once.
...through the kitchen...
Minnie Pearl.
She didn't notice.
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
We're not messing with you...
Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
You could make their heads bleed, though.
No.
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Now when you talk to her, I don't want you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. I want you to be the guy in the rated R movie who you're not sure if you like.
...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Our little baby's growing up...
America has been good to me...
Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
Go back to your house and wait for me...
Like hell I will.
Yeah.
Understood.
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
The Tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.
Sure.
You understand him better than anyone.
It's from Johnny.  It was announced this morning.  He's going to play the lead in the new Woltz Brothers film.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
For bravery.
No.
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
You wanted me to be your son.
I'll need him.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
Yes.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
No.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
Sure, he wants us to send Mike to meet him to hear his proposition. The promise is the deal will be so good we can't refuse.
No no, no more advice on how to patch it up Tom.  You just help me win.  Understood?
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
Thanks Tom.
How will they come at you?
Have you agreed on a meeting?
Michael, I love you.
I told you you wouldn't like him.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
He's my father's godson; he owes him his whole career.
And what do you want for Christmas?
Yeah Kay, I'm here.
Let me think about it, O.K.?
Don't ask me.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
All right, get him in a different room; lock the door from the inside. I'll have some men there inside of fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and don't panic.
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
He talked to you?
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
It's vile.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
Okay.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
This is so good of you.
You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
What?
Copy out from here...
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
What club?
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I thought you'd missed the train.
You've been so good to me. You're the brother I never had. I'm the brother you never had.
No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you?
Really? To Italy?
What evening?
Ciao bello.  Don't you want to fuck every woman you see. Just once.
Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
I hope she never knows.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Sure.
So I'm learning.
What does that mean?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Hello Marge!
To the manner born.
He's having an early night.
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Emily.  Just kidding.
How did you know that?
Is Freddie in Rome?
Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life.
I know.
I'll take them both.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
Thanks.
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
He says so many fiances.
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
I'll fix some drinks.
I give up.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
Well that would be even better gossip.
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiance.
November, I thought.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
It's hell out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. 
Yes, mam.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd be mighty pleased if you'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
What's wrong?
I'm leaving.
Keep it.
Yeah.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
Ouch!
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Is he Italian?
With the other hand, right?
What is it? I'm busy.
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
No.
Could you see anything?
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
Stick up?
A girl needs protection.
I don't like my real name.
I musta been stoned.
Oh, come off it, man.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
He shoots dope too.
Me? I could never go to a place like that.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
Damn straight.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
How's your driving record?
Well then check back tomorrow.
Why do you ask?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
Shit.
What's going on?
Iris?
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
It happens.
Neither do I, I guess.
You want to talk about it?
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
Don't let him do that.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
For christ's sake. Mason trudges down the tu=3Del.  Goodspeed follows him.
It's about time.
Partners.
Hi.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
And  I love you, Pete!
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
I don't smoke?
Oh.
Guess I must've learned.
Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
But what?
A super market.  Huh.
Nine and-a-half years...
Ah.
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
Did you... did you...
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
I guess I did.
We live in a theater?
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
What's his rent?
Huh?
I... I don't believe this.
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Well, that's a relief.  I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
No thanks.
Luke didn't smoke.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
What do you mean?
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me.
You bet, honey.
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
I'll have to think about this.  I have to get back... I should go...
'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
Yes?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
No. Just a few hours.
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
Yes, I did.
Yes?
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
How'd you happen to come here?
What do you mean?
Different?
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
She already has a daughter.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
Look.
It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.
If your father were here...
No!
Yes?
I don't know yet.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
The little Brenner girl.
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Right across the bay there.
What name?
The little Brenner girl?
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
No. Here's fine. 
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
I know, Mother.
Mother?
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
I'm sorry, Mitch.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
What?
Shhhh. Shhhh.
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
That's all right.
Well, I...
About an hour and a half on the freeway. Or two if you take the coast highway.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
How can you tell?
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
Yes?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
Yes.
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
Oh, yes.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
It is for me.
Helping travelers.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
What?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Certainly, of birds.
After the gulls attacked.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
Do you have any lovebirds?
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
To...  To kill them.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
How?
With smoke.
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
Take it easy, lady.  There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.
Of course -- it's the soul of the business -- the pay --
It is a pity.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
MacFarlane
Where can I find him?
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
I remember her.
Who would believe that?  And you know, someone else might recognize her.  She was as well known as the Castle Rock.
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
No.
What?
You couldn't do that, Doctor.
No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
I can't.
Your son, ma'am?  He must have been a fine boy for the wee dog to love him so.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
I've had some experience.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
In the brain, I tell you. I know.
I've drunk enough tonight.
I want to speak to you alone.  I saw something.  I heard.
You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
I'll get him.
Where are they?
I think we should get some support?
I guess it's true. Guns don't kill people...
Keep that thing away from me.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
Nobody.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
It's what Lauren would do.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Sign of the dead come back to life.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
I want you... to bend over.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
About you.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
That's what I came to see you about.
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
Yes.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Okay.
No -- I'm afraid not.
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
Just Klaatu.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
Thank you... Have you any news?
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
You still haven't answered my question.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
You ready?
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Goodnight, my dear.
May I see you for a minute?
What time is it?
It won't work.
Remember those words.
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
That's right.
They would have killed this man?
This isn't a comic book store, right.  It's a bakery.
You gotta drive!
Santa Carla has become a haven for the undead.
The Prince of Darkness.
They're gonna book us.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Yeah.
Are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
I don't want names!  Just lead me to him.  Where's their nest?
Okay, okay.
Whatcha doin' over here?
I thought we were goin' into town.
Who, Laddie?
No.  I'm up.
Mom... please.
You've heard this story before?
We can't talk about it on the phone.
He's already gone to bed.
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
No, I'm not...
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
Yeah.  I'm not trying to replace your Dad... or steal your Mom.  I just want to be your friend.
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Okay.  Talk.
If you want your ear pierced, I'll do it.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Tonight.  At the boardwalk...
Because I love you...
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
No.  Why?
He was protecting <u>you</u>!
Just listen.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Yeah.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
Anybody sick?
I don't know who to trust.
Have you come across Fuchs?
Cool it, Palmer!!
Don't walk behind me.
Let go of me...
Now hold on, you dumb...
Was dark... find a light...
It's shorted out or something!
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
... Where is everybody?!  I'm half frostbit!
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
All in Norwegian.
I think so.
A serum test possibly.
When was the last time you used it?
You reach anybody yet?
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Move it, Palmer.
Can you think of any other tests?
Anyplace but here.
You crazy?  He might be inside already?
The generator!
What for?
No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
Right.  Half of us awake at all times.
MacReady, that you?
When do you think it got to him?
What?!
And everyone looks like us?
What happened?
No...
But there's nothing here.
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Morlocks --
Yes.
What?
This is the way in?
Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
End...?
Oh, you won't be running for long...
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
You know I can't.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Got here as soon as I could.
It's only a machine.
I have something for you...
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
What?
It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
You care for me.  And you're concerned.  And I have to start living my life again.  I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
Sir...?
I don't understand.
All right, all right -- here -- everything --
Thank you.
Why not?
We share everything.
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
How do you decide?
You liked it there.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
You lost someone.
Someone you loved very much.
Is it?
It's undamaged?
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
Imagine that.
Because the assigned curriculum is boring.
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
I took a different route.
New Yorkers.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
Kalen...
That's quite enough, Kalen.
What's it like where you come from?
For our sake, I hope not.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
What about Starks?
We never should have done this to him...
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
Are you kidding me? He's not psychotic!
I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
You sure you know where to find one?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I didn't say I remembered killing him. I just repeated some words to get myself back in there.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
No, we were patients.
I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
Yeah, but I don't know what.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
I don't know.
William, you're not making sense.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
Then, where are you going?
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I guess I'd ask you why.
You're not crazy.
Why?
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
Why would we do that?
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
It doesn't look all that different.
Because I don't have time.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
Who are you kidding, Doc? You or me?
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Don't you go to jail for that?
I wasn't talking about anything.
No.
[Beat] Thanks.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
No, I'm ok.
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
Thanks.
Yup. That's me.
Uh-huh.
What?
Now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
Tell us about him.
A .38.
The important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  We want to try and find out where they are. Now I don't want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  Are you close with her?
My Lord.
Oh, definitely.
It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all take care.
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Who is it?
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
You wanna let me see your license, please?
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
Okay.  I will, too.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Get the car.
Get the car!
Just what is that supposed to mean?
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Give me the keys.
Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
It's probably not a good idea.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Taking a shower.
Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
They don't know that!  It was just you and me there.  I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, it's almost the truth!
Now what what?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
I can see that.
Well, you got it now.
About how fast was I going?
Hit it.
I believe you.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
Yes, Thelma?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
It'd have to be pretty good.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
What?
You too, sweetie, the best.
It's grand!
All this for us?
What are you talkin' about?
Go?
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You got that right.
Hi there!  You alright?
Fresno.
What?
You sent that?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Yeah, right.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
What?
Huh? But why did Healy?
Uh-huh.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Yeah feels like it.
Huh.
Who?
From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her about six months ago at a convention in Las Vegas.
I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an orthopedic surgeon.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Thanks.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Yep.
Dumbshit.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
Ahh.
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Pat Healy.
I already know it, Mary.
I beg your pardon?
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
Here you go.  What's that smell?
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
You're a movie buff?
Warren!
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
Really?  Very, very?
So she's married?
Huh?
She's in a wheelchair?!
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Oh, uh, I resigned.
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Surprised?
What?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Four.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
That must make it tough.
'That right? Good for you.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
He's no Steve Young.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Healy.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Just a minute.
Really? I never got a message.
He's dead.
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Thanks.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
What are you?
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
All right, let's go.
Yeah, sure.
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Okay.
Shhhhhh!
I think a little of both.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
Huh...?
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
Then you'll call, right?
What does the letter say?
Yeah.
Time is of the essence.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
Busy. But you've got his heart.
Forget it, Scotty.
He was.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Acheson's scenario is unacceptable. And he has more experience than anyone.
Cheer up, you've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day.
I don't know. I don't know.
Have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
Yeah, a good political solution.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Jesus Christ...
Hey. Nice tie.
You're my hero, Carl.
Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The Indians don't like white cops poking around. And that's why we're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.
It ain't Geronimo.
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
Beats the hell outta me.
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
She's that subtle?
No way, Cooch.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
He knows me?
He also said "listen to the water."
I don't see the connection.
They found prints at Blue Legs' place.
Crow Horse, listen --
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Sorry.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Yeah. It's time to beat the drum. You better wait here. He don't trust the white man.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
You bought her some time, Kola. Ain't never gonna be over... but you bought her some time.
You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Go ahead, Ray.
Good.
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
It's not that.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
Where were you?
Um. You.
The what?
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
What plane.

About as much as they think about killing me.
You always get what you want?
Anything.
I'm still second best.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
That's what I want.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
What truth?
I hope you find him.
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED.  ROLL IT, COUGAR.
These guys are getting on my nerves.
You.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
NO. NO GOOD.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Roger, I've got it.
Okay.
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Any more MiGs?
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Who's your pilot?
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
What?
I've had enough...for now.
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
I want him!
Time to go.
Was.
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
We did it.
No. You can be mine!
Figured out what?
Three guesses.
Yes sir.
Is that how you remember it?
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
Or....
He was by the book, all the way.
Over there man.
What was that?  An accident?
The Last Resort.
Yeah...Well, actually no...Sort of.
Why not?
But maybe you can change all that.
Thank you.
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
Sorry.  Too perfect.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
I am Quaid.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
No, sir.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
Nice to meet you.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
What is it?
How did I get in this taxi?!
Drive!  DRIVE!!
How real does it seem?
Come on, don't bullshit me.
I guess he didn't.
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
Melina, please...People are trying to kill me.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
Kuato wants to see you.  Come on!
Aliens built it.
It's just up ahead.
I gave you?
No problem.
Cannon fuse.
I think I scared it!
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
Burt, can you hear me now?
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
In a minute.
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
I don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
Do not talk to the driver.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
Damn straight!  Now there's nothing between us and Bixby but nothing!
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Yeah!  Next time I tell you I'm not hung up...!
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
The rifle.
Great.  Thank you.
Sons of bitches!
Little sons of bitches.
Okay, now, how far's your truck?
I think we wait right here.
Well, that's why Edgar never got down off that tower.
Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna help you.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
Don't worry about me, jerkoff.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Hey, just 'cause you're no good with a rope...
Civil?  I'm civil.
What?
You are so full of shit...
She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Let's assume that it is.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
They're working together, too.
Wait!  How are you going to know they're all following it?
Please... I need to sleep...
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Correct.
Sustained.
Complain to the Bar Commission.
Sustained.
Let's snuff this lowlife!
What about entrapment?
Not necessarily...
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Not at all --
Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
We're taking the other case.
1530 Rivington Street.
...What do you mean?
Christ... Shu is innocent.
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
-- Me? Neither.
You're doing a murder case?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
...Okay...
"Painted"?
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
Are you implying that my motives are less than sincere?
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
Calls for speculation.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
-- Every word.
That's right.
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
For control of the prison drug trade?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Shu's the only one I know of...
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
Albert.
A woman.
Blonde.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
I want you to kill for me.
Here he comes.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
You killed Mike.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
Bobby...
Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Yep, it sure is.
Did she have someone with her?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Oh.
Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Smell something fishy, huh?
YOUR SURPRISE, CHET. HER NAME IS LIL.
Right, Gordon. We'll be in touch.
COOP, AGENT CHET DESMOND HAS DISAPPEARED. GONE LIKE THE WIND IN DEER MEADOW.
You are here and there is no place to go...
Sorry to hear it.
Did she ever mention any friends?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
I've thought about that. I think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
What do you mean?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
It's late, Sam.
In that case, we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park.
I'll get my kit.
May I see the magnifying glass, Agent Desmond?  There doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
I don't take it, Sam. I give it.
You didn't do your homework?
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
Nothing.
Not you, Donna, not you.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
Trees?
I understand.
What?
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
...school's fine...
Yes.
There's no one here.
I'm fine.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
And no one will know the truth.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
I wouldn't do it.
Through, through his book.
I am seventy-four years old.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Yes.
When she...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Tell me one?
That's right.
Yes.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
You guys, you guys, you're all the same. The Doctors at the hospital, you... it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's 'We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...' And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
...I made a reservation at...
...What difference would...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
No, you did fine.
Why is that?
Hi. How are you doing?
How old is he?
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
I did.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
My client can't walk, your Honor.
You should have taken their offer. Especially if you were unprepared.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Noted. Thank you.  Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness. Her sole rebuttal was the document, which has been disallowed...
Still looking.
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
Do you want me to go...?
You're talking like a drunk.
Yes.
It's over!
What is that to you...?
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
Yes. Price...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I've got nothing to say to you.
...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
...You're 'sposed to be in court in ten days and she's telling me you haven't even met with them...
Don't touch anything.
...I'm going to need your help...
What?
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
I'm swell.
Yeah. I'm awake.
...one of the other nurses?
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
She did?
You saw Kat in New York...  ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
The Big Boy did...?
Huh.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
Come on out!  We're friends!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Would you like some coffee, General?
Don't you live at home?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
I liked him.
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
How could it happen to everybody's watch together?
It might give us something.
If we get what transportation we can, and pick up instruments and books from Pacific-Tech...
Right.
I just came to tell you - everyone has been alerted.
Well-l...how do you do, Dr. Forrester!
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Well, there's some fellows fishing at Pine Summit might be interested.  They probably saw it come down.  I'll let 'em know...What's it look like?
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
He's very excited about it.
I don't follow.
Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.
Chase. Hi...
Chase, you'd better come home.
Is he all right?
Oh my God...
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
Get her back!  I've got to go in!  Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp.  For Dylan's sake.
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
What?
Bye.
Rex?  Who's Rex?
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Coming for you...
Read me some?
Yes?
Yes.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Dunno.  Just have this feeling today...
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
But it was you that gave Nancy her strength.  So to get out he has to come through you.  And it's inevitable that he'll hit you at your most vulnerable points...
Black's fine.
Your father?
Claiming their place in the world.
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
I didn't know sir.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
To take a piss.
You're not a moron.
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
That's not why he's sending me.
What's the difference?
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
Me too.
Unfurl the squares!
Sir...?
Twice.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
They'll know about it in the morning.
Why would you do that?
Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
I couldn't do it.
Like you'd know what to do with one.
I figured it out.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
It hurts too much to care.
You've gotta be kidding?
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
I'm sorry...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
I understand.
No.  I didn't.
Why? He's right in the groove.
This be it?
Yessir.
How old are you?
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Get out.
No way... GET OUT!!!
Fuck me.
That'd be fine, Bobby.
What's that?
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
When did you talk to Lula?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
Forty bucks...
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
No, of course.
What's the name of it?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
We are in the same businesses and also we are fishermen.
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
Sailor... Lula loves you.
Don't fuck with me, man. You look like a clown in that stupid jacket.
...Asshole.
I'm sorry.
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
That bastard Pucinski...
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
See ya downstairs.
You ain't actin', mama.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
She got me an abortion...
What happened to him?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
You up for that?
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
What kinda trash talk is that?
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Under a hundred.
That'd be good, Lula.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
One bad car accident...
The only one.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Love you, too.
Uh-huh?
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
Shake hands with your daddy.
Lead the way.
SAILOR!!!!
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
I'm sure I wouldn't know, ma'am... and buffalo hunting too... hmmmmm?
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Shoot him.
No.
Yes.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
No...
Shhhhhh...  Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
Whattya mean?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
Life is unpredictable.
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Your wife.
Perfect. Well then, shall we?
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Shut up and drink.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Because... because...
He heard everything we were saying.
Where would we go?
Maybe... I don't know.
Love. It's Love Parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you've read'? You skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
Ye-es?
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
Oh, right. Oola. About that jacket...
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
You did.
And your wife left you.
Her dog, yes.
As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
No sweat. Only do me a favor?
You're in Kinship?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
Sounds like a good one.
Heaven?
So I'm told.
Like the lady herself.
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
That's just what they used to say in the ads. Come on, Crabtree, I know you're holding...
She is. Ah. Here we go...
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
What's he saying?
I put you on the floor.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
Well done, James.
So where have you been staying?
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
No.
Your aunt?
Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Because of my coat?
Jealous? Of me?
I never said that.
Shut up, James. You're annoying. Carrie and Howard don't know what the fuck they're talking about, okay? The entire class combined -- including the lovely Hannah Green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
In a minute. Get us a table.
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I thank you.
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Grady!
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Who does?
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
She's left before...
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I think I might have.
He told me.
I said it didn't sound like you.
And you're old.
It didn't come up.
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
It's Grady, Walter.
I'm in love with your wife.
Taking the long way home.
A jockey? You mean, like --
The perpetrator.
I might have his number on campus.
Just a few then. The big ones.
You want to keep him happy.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
K through sixth.
What?
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
This little table is one heavy bitch.
It wasn't like that.
I know, man. I love this table too.  But I also love my wife.
Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
What's that?
Next week? The week after?
Ask me. Ask me anything.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
That was terrific.
You live around here?
Robin.
Woodsman?
What?
I was asleep.
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
Yes?
Can't I stay a little longer?
Will I see you again?
I said the job is okay.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
No way.
No fucking way.
I'm still thinking about it.
It's okay.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
I don't need someone else.
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
What is your idea of being normal?
Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What did you think would happen?
Is this the first one?
Sorry.
That's my answer.
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
All right.
This is garbage!
What picture?
People without cars.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
What do you think?
Yeah?
You're still here.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
Yeah.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
What did you do to them?
You don't really --
Sounds like a special guy.
Their power. They seduce me.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
I'm not scared.
Just think about it.
Guess that makes you pretty special.
I'm not scared.
Do you want to talk about it?
I told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked ASAP.
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Wasn't up to me.
Your rig?
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
Cute, Virgil.
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
I don't know, look around.
What's the plan?
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
God, I hate that bitch.
Now we're right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  Like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.
Why bring it here?
You watch yourself.
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up Coke.
Turn it up, bozo.
Right on!  Hot rods of the Gods.  Right, Lins? Hey, no really!  It could be NTIs.  The CIA has known about them for years.  They abduct people all the time.  There was this woman I knew in Albuquerque who--
Oh... chamber runs.  Uh huh, that's good.  Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
Gotcha, Cab Three.  Who is that?  That You, Lindsey?
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
We got Russian subs creeping around.  Shit! Something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  Give our folks medals, know what I mean?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Check this out.
It's twitching but it's below the line you said was safe.
What's the timer set for?
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
She'll wait.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
Well, what?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
And why haven't they left each other?
No.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
And what about you?
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Yes... but it's all so conflicting... However, there is some slight indication...
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
Nothing.
Aren't you going to change?
Late, very late.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Tell me once more.
To the shark.
But for what reason should I come there?
But why all nudes?
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
Please, Giulia; must you always emphasize the obvious? I can see for myself that the weather is changing.
When one approaches fifty, my dear, he is affected only by the cold.
Then let's get started... It's senseless to waste any more time.
We'll try again.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
What has everybody got against me this morning?
Here I am.
And where do you find the models?
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
What boat?
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Who?
Why?
Who?
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Agnes...
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Yes Mother.
It made them holy.
Yes, Mother.
It's not that... it's not that...
Yes.
That wasn't me.
Yes.
Right now?
Oh, there are so many.
At least once a week.
Where?
Where'd it come from before that?
I've stopped menstruating
I don't know.
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
Where did you go?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Somebody told her.
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
I'm always bad.
I breathed!
No...
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Yes.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
I'm afraid.
Yes.
Yes.
Because I'm in trouble.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
I can't tell you that.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
Someone's following me.
Above the bed?  Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different?  What is it?
What do you feel?
What do you do?
Yes.
Yes.
So she sent you?
Agnes... Agnes...
Agnes, who did this to you?
Yes.
Yes.
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Who told you this?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
Obviously there was.
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
Look, someone gave her the baby.
The science of psychiatry.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
About two years before.
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
Answers.
Earthquakes?
What is it?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
I don't think I care to know.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Nothing...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Saint Peter?
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
You think she's a saint?
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
Why do you insist upon pressing...
The scandal...
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
I left it with her and I went for help.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Eh?
How about Ding Dong?
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
I'll murder that Lennon.
Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
He's sulking again.
Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Eh, there's only three of them.
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
The big hammer?
Why selfish?
Is she?
Out where?
Books are good!
Parading?
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
Yeah ... a bloomin' book!
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Have they?
Me!
Nothing good.
What's he on about?
You see, sly villains.
Hello.
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
You're undressed. Where are your clothes?
Hiding.
What little old man?
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
No ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Don't be callous.
Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Like what?
Aye, before anyone stops us.
Eh, don't take out me lines.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
What?
No, I'm not.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
What have you heard?
Since you ask, yes.  Aah, come on, Ring, we love you.
He'll get over it.
Good lad, Ringo.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Nerves.
Get knotted!
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Yeah, it's you all right.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Dell, plot our location.
Where the hell are we?
That's what I'm going to do.
But functioning.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
Yes.  There are two points of salient interest.  Number one: it is highly systematized, indicating intelligent origin.  Number two: certain sounds are inconsistent with the human palate.
What?  <u>Why</u>?
It couldn't translate the whole thing, only three phrases.  I'll just read it to you the way I got it:  "... HOSTILE... SURVIVAL... ADVISE DO NOT LAND... "  And that's all it could translate.
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Shit...
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
Dead.
Is it alive?
Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet.
Just hold us together till we're in space, that's all!
I kind of like it.
I hope not.
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
How do we locate the creature?
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
I can't, the acid will pour out!
Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
Oh... God...
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
We can use the flamethrower.
Is it armed?
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
All right.  Now just remember: keep away from those weapons unless I say otherwise.  Martin, do you read me?
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
Is it still dripping?
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Close...
That tube must be depositing it in him.
Yeah?
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Well, it's finally happened.
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
Engine room, what happened?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
Look, I'm not trying to rub anybody's nose in anything.  The important thing is just to get away from here as fast as possible.
They seem native to the planet.  It's got an atmosphere and a dense gravity.  It's dead now, but once it must have been fertile.
Up one kilometer, Jay.
Let's take her into an escape orbit.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Food-storage room!
What do you think?  Now we go in.
The man would need protection, obviously -- as well as some way to drive the thing before him.
Let's be democratic.
Right now let's keep it closed.
Then that tomb... must have been some kind of fertility temple... where they stored their eggs, and maybe held mating rituals...
Here, carry these.
Kablooey.
Yeah...
Wait a minute.
Thanks.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
What's happening?
We're what!?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
You win some, you loose some.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Match it!
Nooooo!
What's our weapons situation?
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
Yeah, I got it.
Yeah, I...
Couple more seconds!
Sounds great.
What's the problem?
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
You've checked that end?
Looks like it.
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
Only six?
Check out the tent.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
Camped out by the navi-beacon out on Linson's Range.  They're making their own way back tomorrow.
You should hit the sack, too.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
That's right.
Yes. I do.
It wasn't meant to be.
Paved with what, then?
Why'd call me a killer?
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
I'm in love with Lloyd!
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
I don't know what I take you for anything...
I never intended you to be.
More plainly and more distinctly? I Have not come to New Haven to see the play, discuss your dreams, or to pull the ivy from the walls of Yale! I have come to tell you that you will not marry Lloyd - or anyone else - because I will not permit it.
She never proved anything, not a thing!
Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Miss Caswell is an actress. A graduate of Copacabana School of Dramatic Arts.  Ah... Eve.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Frankly, I don't remember.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
I take it she read well.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Huh?
Where?
I'm a junk yard.
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Call me when you get in...
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
It's no secret, I know all about the party - Eve wrote me...
How is Eve? Okay?
See you...
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
For instance - you!
Nothing, really...
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
What's all over?
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
Here we go...
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
Glory Hallelujah.
Groom.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I just wondered.
Why you have to go out there.
Is it the money?
I just asked a simple question.
Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
Also Addison deWitt.
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
You're quite a girl.
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
Hmm?
Night an' day.
How did you get in here?
What for?
I've heard of them.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
You rest. I'll get it...
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Hollywood.
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
They certainly don't waste much time.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
Over my dead body...
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
There are other plays...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
Well - if I'm not in the way...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
Really, Eve? Why?
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
They're your fans, your audience-
Harrington.
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
I'm so happy you're happy.
Three or four miles...
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
Check.
Loud.
That book is out of print, Karen, those days are gone. Fans no longer pull the carriage through the streets - they tear off clothes and steal wrist watches...
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
In a minute...
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
Eve?
I wonder why.
That's quite a change of subject.
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Margo!
The play? All right, I guess...
It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all-  - Max you sly puss.
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
I mean really, deeply angry...
The situation I'm in ain't the kind you can belch your way out. I made a promise...
A couple of weeks.
All you got to do is name it.
But what could she do?
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Answer my question!
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
Let me lay a little theory on you--
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
We need a sympathetic face.
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
--fifteen phone calls--
You're not a kid anymore.
How high up, which Republicans?
It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
We're inside the White House now.
Who?
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
--We got twenty minutes to deadline--
So I guess you could say that we screwed up, but we weren't wrong.
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
Night.
Whatever.
Well of course.
And?--
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
--there's nothing new in it--
Absolutely--
Where are your bills, Carl?
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
I don't know what they'd do to me.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
What do you want to know?
--they're worse. That's why I quit.
To cover up?
Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
--it's gotta be Haldeman--someone from the White House had to be involved--
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
My non-denial denial.
Go on.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
He approved the payments to Liddy while he was still Attorney General--
OK.  You're about to write a story that says that the former Attorney General-- the man who represented law in America-- is a crook.  Just be right, huh?
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Look, I told you inside--
You're a lawyer and you're here--
Where?  What do you mean, where?
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
Haldeman too?
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
--yes, yes, what is it?
James McCord.
It may never come out.
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
As opposed to the Committee? The Committee's not an independent operation. Everything is cleared with the White House. I don't think that the FBI or the prosecutors understand that.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Like what?
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
Yep.
Uh-huh.
Seduce her.
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
I'm glad you think so.
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
I'm not playing.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Sure.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Did you guys hook up or something?
Yeah, that's right.
Uh...
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.
No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This is more important than any bet.  Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Right.  That gives us...
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Went home to shit.
Just in time.
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Holy shit!
She's already on a plane back home.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Dad, come in.
Do you know about the clitoris?
Okay, well that about covers it.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Michelle.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
So do I, Kev.
Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for you.
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
Me?
Oh no.
No, no, I'm not done!  I've got reserves!  Nadia, please please please.  I'm begging you.
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
You think so?
How?
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
No...I know the perfect time...
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
<u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there are no excuses.  You guys have to --
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Keep it down, dude.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Thanks.
Uh huh.
Doing what?
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
What?
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Andy! No!
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
Really.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Why isn't it doing anything!?
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
Yeah?
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
Andy? Andy is that you?
Sort of...
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Okay. So maybe you were right.
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Then come find me.
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
Well, I don't have any money . . .
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Trying... to... breathe...
You are the Princess.
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
I'm glad you	did too.
Anya... where are we?
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Yes, you do. You do.
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
Shut up!
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Young	man, I...
And tell me that she's happy.
You gave the orders!
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Well, why not?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
M'm.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Well, where is it? I-
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Well...
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
M'hm...
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Fifteen years, yeah.
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
Yeah!
Oh, all right.
Yeah.
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
H'm?
M'hm.
U-huh.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Yeah.
I dunno.
I have a tiny apartment.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
I didn't follow you!
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Whatta you mean? Me?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Will it change your wife?
Oh.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
I'm cool.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now...  they're ahead two points.
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand...  the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
Oswald and ghosts.
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Key word here is "indulgent."
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Tell him.
May I see your license, please?
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Right, Max. California, Max.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
You'll total the whole car.
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
V.P.L.?
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
We're gonna operate together.
His wife has diabetes!
She was stealing.
Who's persecuting? She stole!
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Yeah.
Hey-
It was a wonderful set.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
I was very charming.
A long time.
Oh yes.
What?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Of course.
Borrow whatever you like.
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Yeah.
Damn straight.
Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
Leave us alone right now.
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Hm.  We should do it again.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Man, I must really be stoned.  Thanks, buddy.
Well, you're a tower of support.
Before I forget.  Put it on the bookshelf.
Just do what I say, alright?
Hardly...
I'm going to throw up.
It's alright.  Be our guests.
Whatever!  You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day...
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Well he can't have gone far.
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't push me away.
You changed your mind.
Everybody hates the messenger.
I'll be with you.
Okay.
Will you make love with me?
Oh, you know, I am.
Come on, Panes...
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Still.  Well.  Let's drop it.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Here, drink this.  Drink lots of water.  Hold on to this.  Take deep breaths. Nice and slow.  Would you like a lolly?
I think he's really angry with me too.
A lot of cakes.
How long have you been married?
Come here.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
Clair is a hovering mother.
Not good.
You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water.
Yes.
Excuse me?
Don't go in, Ryan.
Sally?
Are you working on a new book?
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
Yes.
Very.
It's a machine gun.  I thought I'd kill myself.
Oh great.
You don't know she's a bitch.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I didn't hear me say tonight.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
No.  Not something new.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
You don't need to thank me.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like.
Hmm.  Where are my kids?
Would you like to meet my husband?
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Sophia!  I'm not even pregnant!
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
That's right!  He slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
Right...because every ant's important!
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
Wanna dance?
<u>What</u>?
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
You -- you think I'm right?
Uh, sorry, General, I...I've always had this animal magnetism, it --
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Hlllllllp!
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Oh no...
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Mom!
Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Superior numbers, kid!
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Outstanding.  Princess...?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
That's correct, sir!
No, sir!
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Terrific!  You <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't <u>mind</u> that I don't <u>matter</u>!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
My mother.
Under the mat? 
Well, I have some paper towels --
Care to make a small wager?
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Good night.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Would you like to?
Yeah.
How is your cold?
Oh.
Eight-thirty!
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
You shouldn't.
Cheers.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Much better.
This is a bad day for me.
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Baxter.
Miss. 
As soon as I can walk.
They had to pump it out.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
I'm not very good at it.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
I guess so.
I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
No, I don't.
Where?
In the knee?
The dishes?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm fine.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Seven --  -- queen.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
I don't know.
What kind of joint are you running?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Yes, sir.
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
You too, sir.
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
Sir?
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Yes, sir.
I got kicked in the head, too.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Thank you, sir.
You?
Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
I have a vague idea.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
Let me get my bag.
Something like that.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Sure, Doc.
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
A.W.O.L.?
Dr. Dreyfuss.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
Always happy to do something for our girls in uniform.
Let me take that.
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Okay. I'm sorry.
Handle what?
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
I told you -- with my mother.
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal.  Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
It won't happen again.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Yeah.
I like all of them --
I said I like all of them.
Sure, thanks.
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
Fat. That's real fat.
Who are you ?
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Yes, sir --
No shit.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
Yeah, it is.
Looks that way.
Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
Yeah, I know.
Said I speak French like a Spanish cow.
Let's go.
Shot himself. What for ?
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
Thta's not Charlie's work --
What is it?
If they have boats ... or canoes... they'd get lost in the fog. We can't move either -- we'll end up on the shore.
Yeah, it still runs.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Charlie?
They must have seen the fire.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Do you know that jungle?
What about an American named Kurtz?
Your daughter.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
What, sir?
What?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
I got bored in Saigon.
No. Walked.
When did you hear?
He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
No -- no, sir.
You know you're right.
We'll exterminate the fuckers !
What?
Which one's the Colonel's?
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
So Kurtz is alive.
And shut up.
I should be checking on the boat.
What did you hear?
What things?
The river is beautiful.
You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
Mind if I get some stuff from my kit?
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
I just want this over with.
157  CONTINUED:
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
168  CONTINUED:
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
Back against the bars.  Now.
She's dead.
Why?
He still might be around.  I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
Be careful -- there're two of them.
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
It's exactly what you meant.
Prolonged darkness makes people crazy.
I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
Yeah.  Maybe so.
Smart?  Sure.  That's why I'm sitting in this plane and they're down there blowing me kisses.
You sound like the tourists. Know-it-alls who read about survival in a magazine.  Fuck you.  You won't make it off this mountain.
I'm right behind you.
You don't feel cold?
Where's my ELT?
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Don't bet on it.
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Shut up!
Like I said, I'd still be up on that mountain, frozen solid, it wasn't for you.
If that was all, fine.  But carving him up, stranding the others, that's too fucking much. Is everything that walks, crawls, flies or swims fair game to you?
Sure.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
It's a long shot.
I'm right fuckin' here with you.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
Go ahead.
Spencer's doing fine. So what are you saying, that you're frustr...
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
I'm a waitress.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
My son is sick, okay?
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
What's that got to do with it?
Are you still coming?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
Nonsense!
Dancing?
No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
Okay. Good-bye.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Were you asleep?
What a break...
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Okay.
You know what? I...
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
I'll take care of myself --
What are you trying to do to me?
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
So am I, Frank.
Sure -- take him to the vet.
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
See, he's right. I need the cards.  Simon, you're broke.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Ask him.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
This stuff is pointless.
I'm going back with you.
I'm coming.
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she doesn't want contact with me.  I'm dying here.
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
What's it mean?
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
Yeah, it's terrible.  I mean Valli, and I don't care what office he's running for, the guy's a crook.  He probably had it coming, but all the other people.  Real sad.
What?  You think I'm running you up?
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
We go around once.
I know you're going to jump.
I ain't scared of you.
That's right.
Bain!
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.  A year ago there was a fire in the old Hotel Paraiso. This is the new Hotel Paraiso.
Sick.  The flu.
Know what?
Tomorrow.  The buyer is Japanese. His retirement a condition of the bonus.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
He stole another contract.
He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yes.
We don't have a choice.
It's simple.  You need me.  I need you.  And we will both need money.
No.  It's the truth.  I know what you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're a ghost, you're not part of the real world.  You don't have a social security number.  You don't pay taxes.  You've probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  A long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  You think you can do it again.  But I'm telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  No matter what you do, where you go, I swear to you that Bain will find you.
What do you want to know?
It's not the same, is it?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Why?
Where you wanted to be?
The C.I.A.?
You went from high school to the Agency?
Ahhhh...
The exotic women.
Why did you leave the Agency?
Oh.  What do you think about?
Here?
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
Sorry.
The beach?  It was nice.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I didn't notice them.
Jesus, if someone had --
I'm sure you will.
It can be.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
Okay.
Yes.  Please come in.
Everyone regrets something.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
Do you believe that?
Why not?
It's possible.
It's a common question.
Taken.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
That's correct.
Thank you.
A coke, if they have it?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Like you?
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
That makes you an expert I guess.
A locksmith too? Why d'you ever bother with writing?
And if the police stop by - what do I tell them?
No, just making my contribution to cultural enlightenment, that's all.
Tough break.
No....The Asylum!
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
Can you do the lock on it?
Is it gone four-thirty?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
Holly!
It just happened.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
He's lying! I am.
So?
Lucky break!
We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
What?
No!
Sure I'm sure!
Do you know the way?
No, by road?
Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
That one?
No!
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
You used to read.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
What? You are crazy!
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
Don't worry it's okay!
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Thanks.
And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
What for?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
We don't need you.
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
No, just a coffee.
Guests.
Uh-huh!
Yeah, but it was okay.
Alright!
That's right.
It was the biggest I could find.
A kind of freedom.
Not all of them!
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Working....Under cover.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
You bastard!
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
We're not sure...
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
Some Americans?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
Very well.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
I'll tell her you were here.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
I'm just wondering --
Demented.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
Me.
-- This play means a lot to me.
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
That is my telescope.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
My relationship with God is my own.
Yes. And?
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
You're hardly nice to anyone.
That sounds like horseshit.
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
What?
You're sometimes not sure?
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Not possible.
Loved?
Twice a year.
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Where's the one you're building?
What about your father?
Me.
I don't care.
I should have told you sooner --
That I want you to take me home.
I don't want to come here anymore.
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
He wants help with his lines --
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
Dad --
Does it have to do with Jamie?
I don't want to see her hurt.
Like what, sir?
Either. Both.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
I want to come back.
Yeah.
A similar triangle?
Oh yeah.
But he didn't ask me.
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
Say what you were supposed to say in the cafeteria.
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Get behind the shield! I'm about to release radiation!
Is Shemp all right?
Sure! Listen -- we take the racing results from today's paper...
A mall?
We don't....
You were ringing the doorbell!
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
Well, it was there.
You did what?!?
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
Professor -- there are some doors that shouldn't be opened, Marty said softly, without turning around.
The Orpheum.
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
He said not to tell.
Not bad.
He never bit me.
Tom...
What'd you come out here for?
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
You love him?
What for?
What?
Sure.
He'll say that?
I don't know.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
But it would hurt.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
You said that once already... Too late now.
He was nervous.
Just looking.
I don't know.
Excuse me.
Positive?
I don't blame him.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
No.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Just thinking.
Hold it right there.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the Overthruster...
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy if you want my opinion.
The door's locked.
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
Who?
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
A what?
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
Where do you hail from, Doc?
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
...I know this must look... funny.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?
I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand productive days." What a goddamn phony.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Drown all those rascals...
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
...Who?
What DID you mean?
W.P. Mayhew? The writer?
Well... actually, no Bill...
Ever act?
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected 
Well I...
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism  if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
No, what did it say?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine  you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
Seems like nothing but, lately.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
You gotta believe me 
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to 
But I didn't do it  don't you believe me?
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime  when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!
Yes sir, they 
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was  well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
Must be.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
What 
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
No kidding, bright boy  we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
He's a little funny in the head.
Only fry you once.
You two have some sick sex thing?
No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
When did you start drinking again?
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
Sometimes I really hate you.
No.  I mean it, thank you.
What did she tell me, Beth?
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
I loved him.  I hurt.
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
She wiped out her whole family.
No.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Do you?
What if I call you Nicky?
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
To see if I can get away with it.
No?
When?
You paid $50,000 for your character?
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
I don't know.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
Really.  What are you writing about.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
Cocaine.
Routine.
Do you remember his name?
What are you doing here, Pop?
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
I got tired of being played with.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else.  How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
What do you want?
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
We bring her in for questioning.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
No.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Well, have you asked her to come back?
I don't like beer.
No.
You haven't been by lately.
How about right now?
Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Yup.
Out?
Still not here.
What's wrong with you today?
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
Medicine, man! Like health food. I'm taking care of my health!
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
What who's saying?
I hadn't thought about it.
Staten Island would be ok.
I don't believe it, Jean  they're picking straws.
What's his name?
Me? Why?
Sure. I'd be glad to.
Thanks
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
I need this?
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
Yes, I suppose that we did.
I'm -- sorry, I --
Hanging on every word.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
Maybe you're right.
No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
Treat to be here.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
"We"?  You and...
Had one.  Didn't work.
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
Weird, huh?
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
Silent night, violent night...
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
Actually, it's a lot like that.
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Uncle Alfred left for America.  Much to my mother's dismay -
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
What seems to be the problem?
Specify, please.
Pheromones?
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Keep it.
I'm afraid to ask.
I didn't kill your wife.
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
I thought you were going to stay in the museum and round up the thugs.
What are you talking about?
She knows who we are.
Umm.  What I mean is...no plans at the moment...
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
You lie!
Kill them.  Of course.  But why stop there?  Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Adam and Evil.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
What exactly are you working on in there?  What are those screams?
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
Perhaps. Perhaps not. Why not ask the lady?
Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
How ya doin', Al?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Slanta.
Wacko? That a technical term?
Would you? I'm not so sure.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
Well, I met someone...
What?
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
What I do isn't about revenge.
How could I forget?
Paranoid? The psychotic?
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
Let's see if you bleed green.
Haven't you had enough? Don't Think And Drive.
You're a genius.
Oh yes, and certainly _WE_ will!
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
Too many people. Come on!  SHIELDS!!
Better. It's not on the market yet.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
... Looks like a convention.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
I feel naked without it.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
Finding out where she is.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
WHAT?
It's a detour. They're backed up for blocks!
Eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
What are you talking about?
God!  How old are you?  There ain't no bat.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
I've considered that possibility.
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
... Behind the makeup?
Too much glamor, huh.  What's in the bag - - Monte Carlo?  Apes in Kenya?
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
What were you thinking?
His face.  Allie, look at his face.
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Everybody needs a hobby.  You explain it, Vicki.  He walks out on his own party.  Half an hour later, who turns up?  Batman.  Sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  No place to change.
Bruce Wayne is out of his mind.  Next time you call him up and he can't go out Friday night - - think it over.
You okay?
I need some time, David.  A little time.  It's not just you.  It's partly me.
David, I'm serious!
Meaning?
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
Night.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
Ahm.... .
Yes.  I'11 mention it to him.  But ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
She's ... well, she's good.
Yes, isn't he.
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.  I'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
Great news.
Thank you, sir.  Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we can ...
Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Congratulations. Marvellous thing.  Bravo.
Certainly is.
What makes you say that?
Sean Connery.
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Sure did.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
Yes?
Okay.....
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
Why thank you sir.
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Yeah, heh heh.
Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh heh. Anus. Heh heh.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all gonna die!
Yeah, we should party.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Uh... Uh...
Huh huh. You mean like this?
Yeah really. Let's get outta here Beavis. Huh huh huh. This sucks.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Huh? Huh huh.
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Dill-wad...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Well, if you find yourself getting tired, take a couple of these.
Heh heh, thanks.
OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Bork, don't you realize what kids today are capable of? Don't you read the papers?
Cut the power!
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Cool, huh huh.  Hey Beavis that's that dude that's paying us to do his wife.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Won't?  Or can't?
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
We don't know who he is...  ... I'm going to talk to that little girl.
We probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
Where are your skulls and bones?
Three times.  Powerful number.
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.  My nails keep getting longer.  I'll break them.
... acts like she's thirty-five.
Just a hunch.
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross under there?  Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there?  Like all bloody veins and pus?
I got an A!
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Now, let's get rolling!
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
<u>Out</u>.
We're...
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
Wait... I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
No, Lydia, we're dead.
Jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! We're not interested in selling.
Yes.
That's it!
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
... I will.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
Stepmother.
I'm lonely.
No listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, I gotta go, I gotta meeting on the Japanese joint venture.
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
I say let's keep it the way it is.
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
I saw some ghosts.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
Shhhh.  They didn't commit suicide.
I'm sorry already.
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
Maybe Charles does.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Oh, fine.
Claim...? ... Oh, claim, that's what Thomas asked me.
Hardly any, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
That is so true. You're different, Chauncey... Quite different than most men.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Oh? Certainly...
No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
That's good.
Good night, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Our greenhouse.
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
How is Ben feeling?
Thank you, Eve.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes, very well, thank you.
I certainly do.
Yes. You look very sick.
Yes. I am very hungry.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
Thank you, Ben.  ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
I understand.
I want to tell Eve.
I can't write.
Yes. I like to watch.
What sort of bed is it?
Yes.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
... Yes sir - elevator!
Is his back feeling better?
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
I'm going to work in the garden.
You're welcome.
I hope so.
Yes. I was there with Ben.
Compensated...?
I was given meals, and a home...
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Are you related to the deceased, Mr. Chance?
No, Thomas. I have never been in an automobile.
I would like to stay and work in my garden.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
Come now, Mr. Chance.
... Hello.
... I realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on Gardiner. We have no material on him - zilch...
Try again.
I said - try again.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Yes, ma'am.
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
It's not that, I just...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
We have nothing on him, Ambassador Skrapinov.
Right, Chief.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Yes, I did.
The one where you're that jewel thief.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Hmmm.
Hi.
The ferret?
Yeah. You want a beer?
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
We'll talk about it in the car.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. Well smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Shut up!
It'll never happen, fuckface.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Simulates?
That... was... no... simulation.
Schwartz.
Schwartz.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
I wouldn't know.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
I just wanted to say hi.  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
You're a fag or a liar.
Yikes.
It better be.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
My God.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Well, Don, I peeked in here, even though I know it's against floor policy. and I discovered that there's a little tiny door in here. Isn't it cute? It's almost like a little dolly's door. I wonder what its for.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
But I think I have another plan.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Fork ah did?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Do we get to wear a crown?
No.
You bastard!
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
Did you see the reviews?
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
It's okay, my sweet.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
Folks come. Folks go.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
Baby, don't be like that.
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
Don't pay to complain.
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Thank you.
I will.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Yes ma'am.
Well, what can you do?
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
You sure?
Better ask Paul D.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
You know she married Baby Suggs' boy.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
That's so.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Who is she? Where she come from?
She what run you off? Not what I told you 'bout Sethe?
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Dude, I finally got the venue I wanted.  I'm Performing my dance quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on Tuesday night, and I'd love it if you came and gave me notes.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
You're not dealing with morons here.
Why me, man?
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Yeah, it sucks.
Come and get it.
ANTI-SEMITE!
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental house.
That is for the urn.
And this guy peed on it.
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should compensate me for the fucking rug. I mean his wife goes out and owes money and they pee on my rug.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Walter, how--
Were you listening to the story, Donny?
Huh?
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
Well--
Uh-huh.
Lebowski on the right?
Are these.
I see.
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
On you, maybe.
I thought you might know, man.
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
The main guy, Dieter--
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, you know him?
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
So Dieter has the money?
Maude?
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
What the fuck are you--
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over the line!
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
Whose toe was it, Walter?
But Walter--
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry ma'am.
Dude--
Nihilists!  Jesus.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Look, man, did you--
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
We know it's his fucking homework, Walter!  Where's the fucking money, you little brat?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
And the fucking money!
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
What's your point, Dude?
Yeah?
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
A hundred and eighty dollars?!
Walter--
You're a fuck, Walter!
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Who is this?
...Us? DUDE
You are approaching a vooden britch. When you cross it you srow ze bag from ze left vindow of ze moving kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch you.
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Dude.
I don't know, sir.
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
Well we--I don't--
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not occurred to me.
Stay away from me, mister!
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Impressive.
We'll take 'em in the morning.
Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Why?
Like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth.
Sounds like a plan.
You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  Isn't that how the saying goes?
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
Look, what's your problem?
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Look, kid, they obviously found your base of operations.  If it was a trap, why flip their dicks by announcing themselves?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Are we bringing home strays now?
You should've killed her, then.
How can you be out here?
It's because I'm human that I can do this.
How do I stop it?
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
And that's a good thing?
It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
What do you see here?
We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story.
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.
For them. But for me --
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in.
Hey, folklore--
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.
Oh, sorry, right.
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
There's some stuff that's hard to part with. Editing's stuff's up there--
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
--whatever; that's her.
Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an <u>old</u> tree.
Why is there no "our" here?
You said the name "James."
I can't.
I can't let you in.
Both. Now.
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
Who do you know who can? Where do we go?
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
Butt-ugly owl.
Still don't see it--
Well, she got out of here <u>some</u>- how because she's not here!!
--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
Down there in the Park.
How's she going to know where to--
Next time try putting on shoes--
--I don't know.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--Domini!
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
All I need--
--still go see the OB in the morning--
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
Enough to keep sane.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
And what's your excuse for being here?
Then I have no idea.
Sure. I'm sorry.
Go to the store. When you get back, I'll try to make sense of it for you.
--she wasn't a witch--we embrace nature, not evil--
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Domini.
You're needed here--keep watching--
Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
I just gotta see a guy.
What?
...Huh?
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Thanks.
You're bad.
I said you're bad.
...What do you mean?
What the hell happened, Ray?
All right...
Isn't that what you want?
We don't seem to be communicating--
Ever durned one.
What?
Lubbock?
Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't married to him.
You owe me for two weeks.
No. It just made them feel better.
Got a job for you.
It's not strictly legal.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
I want you to go fishing.
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
How would I know?
What's the point?
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
You did? A human ear?
Okay.
The criminals are winning.
Yes.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
It's blue. blue velvet.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
. mommy's here.
Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  . Hey, pretty, pretty.
Alright, suit yourself.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
I sprayed your apartment. I took your key. I really didn't mean to do anything but see you.
I'll go then.
Do you know?
Who's it, you mean.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
Hello.
Frank is coming?
I sure don't hate you.
That's good.
Whatiya mean?
Does that scare you?
Sometimes I think I do.
Just get outta my bed.
You put your disease in me. your semen. it's hot and full of disease.
I did. are you?
I want you to stay with me.
No.  Hi baby.
It's okay. it's okay.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yes.
There ya go.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Terrible. boring.
That's too bad.
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
Yeah. Good bye.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Alright.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
I'll drink to that.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Oh, okay. can I call?
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
That's what I thought.
I will.  I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
You better not, Jeffrey.
You want to go talk to him?
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey!!
Where to?
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
uh uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
This is it.
You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Okay.
Where do you guys want to count?
Derek!
What is?
You'll see for yourself.
Are you kidding?
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
What?  You're not going to wait for me?
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
We want some grass.
No.
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
Here's the best part.  We can charge five-hundred a pound.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
Get me a six pack.
I don't want to talk about it.
Not really, no.
Because they caught me?
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
I just got released five minutes ago.
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Just sell it, Derek.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
You went behind my back and you cut me out.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Oh, I see.
Actually, it was three.
With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my partner.  I do not do business without him.
Family.
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I'm going to California.
Not mad.
I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.
That's where you belong...
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
Tuna.
Why are you smiling?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
Out.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Yeah.
Kristina's fine.
Better than you.
What's happening to us?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
How are you doing?
You can call me Dad if you want.
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
You mean, like a trip?
Yeah.
California.
Where are you going?
I know, Dad.  I know...
Okay, George.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
So, we need to get to the source.
Who speaks Spanish?
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like it.  I'm fucking wasted.
You know, he's got a point.  We're fucking Americans.  We stick out like sore thumbs.
Don't be such a pussy.
The strike is a success; but ...
Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Sid Ahmed.
Don't move, Hacene.
I'll explain.
I don't even know your name yet ...
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Let's try ...
I think it'll be a success ...
No, they'll do even more. We've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... Do you understand what I mean? Starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self-confessed criminal ... And they will be able to pass to the offensive. Have you thought of this?
Of course I am.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
So -- where do we start?
You got something on the Coke?
Thanks, Mister D.
But there's more?
Yes.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
Did Miss Lawson ever give you any indication why she was leaving?
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning.  We would have looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Back off, John.
No.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
Rebecca Lawson.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Yes.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
Thank you.  The State rests.
We stopped seeing each other.
No.
No.
Yes.
No.
No.
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Yes.
No.
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
I'll have you out in a few hours.
I thought the subject was sex?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Hi.  It's Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
It's okay.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
What?
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Yeah.
I love you too, Dad.
Really?
I'm always open to learning new things.
He could let you have your vacation.
I don't know yet.  I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
I'll talk to him later.
We have to talk.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
What time did you leave?
It's not that long.
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
I know. I don't understand it either.
No treasure maps, huh?
Aw, Betty.
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Did we want to?
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
They got heat in Michigan.
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
You want me to call the doctor?
Oh, that'll be nice.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
Hmm-mmm.
No.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
I don't mind waiting.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Want another cigarette?
Not at all.
Oh. How old?
Must be nice having kids.
Clean?
She starts sniffing me.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
No. But I love them just the same.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
Do you want to leave your husband?
Yes! Hi.
Oh, sure. Great.
Yeah. See you later.
I want you to come.
Oh, how is he?
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Are you hungry?
Why?
No, I don't mind.
What?
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
No.
Well, what is this?
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
WHY?
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
Cremated?!
Apparently just before her death.
WHAT!
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Damn.  It's so...fresh.
Go for it.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Naw.  I think it's... I dunno.  Something about it just buzzes me.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Climb out to where?
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
I don't know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
Where we'll always be...
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
I have to finish this for class.
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
You said bad things hurt places.  So maybe good things heal them.  Good things are happening here.  Maybe for the first time ever.  And maybe that's all it takes.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
My God.  My dress.  We have to find it. And burn it.  And shut the door.
You moved into this block?
Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
Yeah.  But when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. The fabric tears.
You got the shit?
Let me see it.
I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And I can't go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up yourself.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
Shit, that was fast.
No, Eddie.  It's just that, I dunno.  He was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  All I remember is the voice.  It was smooth and low and it didn't seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
Not that I remember.
That building?
Save him?  What are you talking about?
Evidence of what?
What we have to do is call the police.
You want to get into this now?
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.
I think you're fucking crazy!
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
Why?  'Cause you know him?
It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable!
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
Caesar, this is crazy.
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Where, then?
We're going to need some time.
Just hurry.
He can't kill you --
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
They were in a car accident.
Yes, I understand.
I should have let him kill you.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Pretty good, sir.
Five.
Hey, Mickey.
Caesar, you still got the money?
Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.
Me?  Why?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.
Oh yeah.  Violet!
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
...  thank you.
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Good guess.
Thanks.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
Why?
...  yes.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
You have to ask?
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
Yes, it is.
He was in love with you, right?
For what?
You think I'm lying?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Yeah.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
What happened?
Hey.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.
Hey, Johnnie ...
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
I think everything is okay.
I'm not asking.
What if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  What if he turned?
Our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  Even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  This is it.  He's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  You give him another day to run and we may never find him.
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
So it's time to go home.
MPG Capital.
It's a lot more stressful than I thought.
Right.

Yes, sir...  How can I help you?
One moment, please...  I'm afraid, I have no one by that name registered, sir.
Yes, I'm here...
...I understand...
Yes.
Get the fuck away from my car.
You have blood on your pants.
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
I can't believe I slept.
Looks familiar?
Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
Thanks for the ride.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
I guess so.
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
I didn't know this would happen.
And where is he now?  You believe what you want, but I'm telling you the truth -- I never would have brought you here if I thought it was dangerous.
-- there's no time --
-- forget it --
Nykwana Wombosi. 
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
I don't know. 
xxxxxx
We have to keep moving.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
That's the only angle.
Enhance it.
<u>Where am I</u>?
I told you.  You need to rest.
... have a look.
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
...aven't you?
What? How do you know my name?
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
Bad sportsmanship. A ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. They just can't stand seeing the other fellow win. If these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
Your father and I were very close. Of course Jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and I  keep his name alive at the office every day.
Well ... well, I ...
Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Even later.
Really? - God, how time flies!
You remember Alison?
Quite, absolutely - I always thought they were false.
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Ah ...
How do you mean?
Not much.
What has Tuttle done?
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
You're the only person I can trust.
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Do you know what you're doing.
Shut up!
What?
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
What parcel?
Suit me?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Well, no system is.
Well, all wars do -
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Every day?
Oh God! What have we done?
No you're not!
Yes.
Your face ... are you hurt?
Take care.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Information Retrieval.
Don't worry.
I mean, Buttle! It's been confusion from the word go! He's been wrongly charged for Electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Next of kin!
Here.
I delivered it.
I did it for you.
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
A woman eh? I see.
This is your dream girl, is it?
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
A most perceptive choice, Madam, if I may say so.  Monsieur?
What is it?
Mother!
Mistake?
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
What? Now? It's my lunch hour.
Er, yes ...
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Numero trois, steak.  Monsieur, Mesdames, Bon appetit.
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
It's a 27B/6 of course.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
He flipped out.
Stressed? He's psycho.
Mary said you might be coming.
No!
You're going to live.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Ten-four, hon.  This is for you.
Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
Ten-four, hon.
What's his name?
What did you say?
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
You look so different.
How is she?
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Fifteen minutes.
Can I bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!  Anybody else hurt?
He was tough. You did all you could.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Look out!
I never felt better in my life.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Why?
Okay, whatta I do?
Frank!
Frank!
You're crazy.
What?
He's drunk.
No way!
Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
What?
The pointers were great.  I'll study the tape.
I'll put her on.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.  That's a promotion!
Are you any closer to a decision?
Yes.
Ravenous homosexual.
Why do you say that?
Sure.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
No.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
No!!!!!
This isn't friendship.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...  ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
Your hair's a little funny.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
I'll speak to you soon
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
No, I don't think so.
My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
Nobody else had it.
Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening.  What's wrong?
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
I'll speak to you.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Okay, sweetie.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
No.  Not even you.
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
I just wanted to tell you  how great you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
Excited.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
What?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
Uh-huh.
Oh, good.
Good.  That's it...See you.
Great.
Because you're nuts.
Well, when?
Yes.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
You fucking...
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
I'm sorry.
I just might.
Oh yeah?
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Shh!
Sit in this chair, and I'll pose you.
You're breaking my concentration!
Now you're a professional!
Oh...
Better!
There there...
Walter!  Jeez!
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Hm...
Carla -
When did you make this, Walter?
I'm honored to know this man.
Oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
Nothing...nothing at all.
I do the research.
Not only that, he copied us!
I know, man.
I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
I didn't buy it I made it.
What, Mr. De Santis?
I-I already got a new one!
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Huh?!!!
C-connection?
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Turn around!
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Did you like it Mister Brock?
Uh, I don't know.
Good morning Walter!
Here here!
Really?
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
I want to be part of it, I want to inspire you, I want to do - something!
If you see him.
Good night, Mrs. Swicker -
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
I had him in my grasp.
Jeffrey, I don't mean to sound sexist or anything, but can I borrow her?
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Andy, start breaking up some chairs. You'll need weapons.
Suck!
Amazing!
You look like shit, Benny.
What's playing there?
Probably.  What movie is this?
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
Uum... around ten?
It's the news, Buffy.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
You were having a nightmare.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Jealous?
'Bye.
I thought we were meeting here.
Have you ever thrown up in the front row of a Richard Marx concert?
Buffy.
It was.  I think it's pretty much ready for the --
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
No, you're not.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
I know.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
What for?
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
) What do you think?
Why don't we see a movie?
Please.  They show previews for foreign movies.
Buffy, I'm gonna tell Jeffrey you were playing with another man's Hebrew National.
I forgot.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
To bring you... your birthright.
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
In Virginia.
Lothos.
I have to show you.
Cramps?
We wait for Robert to wake up.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Try to pay attention.
Fine.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
It's natural.  A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  It's part of how you are able to track them.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Don't start with me again.
I...
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
As for example, what?
Vampires of the world, beware.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
Toasty.  You should come; it's gonna be a great game.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
He knows who I am!
That's the plan.
I was just scared is all.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Hi, Grueller.
Does Jeffrey know?
Wit-tay.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
You want some punch?
Right!
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Like you've got a grip.
You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
It's all the same thing.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
I'll be back when we lose.
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
So...Wanta make love?
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
He looks great, just great!
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He'll learn.
Which one of us?
Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Never heard of 'em.
You missed him!
No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
But he ain't seen my heat--
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
Then go.
C ' mon!
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
And where can I go?
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
We'll be praying for you.
Ain't he warning up?
It's a league record.
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
...and one helluva guy.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
It's a damn convention.
I can't believe you're doing this.
I was in the building!
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from -
Yeah.
Lester...
They payin'?
And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
Look at you. You're fuckin' walkin' around like John Barrymore.
...to me.
It's none of my business?
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
Meet me at three.
Why?
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Well...
Yeah, she's here.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
You bet.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
I'll come by.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
Good to meet you.
What can I do?
Ace, listen to me.
Why is she eight pounds over?
I...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
No. Just stop everything.
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
Oh, no.
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Yeah, I know all that.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
I'm not crying. 
Yeah.
It's chinchilla.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
Yeah, how do I know?
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
What's it...
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
...twenty-five thousand?
Okay?
Yeah.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
Get out of here!
I threw it away.
Oh.  I got your cigarettes.
What did Jennifer have?
Who were you with?
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
You want your jewelry?
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
I'm not -
Not gonna let me in?
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
How many kids do you have?
Eight children! 
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.
I really think you're -
You're firin' me?
Listen, if you didn't know you're bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' dumb to keep this job. If you did know, you were in on it. Either way, you're out!  Get out! Go on.  Let's go.
Green?
God! 
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
What?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
Get out of here.
I didn't give 'em the m-
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Please.
Jeff, would you go in with her?
I can't.
Hey!
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Yeah?
Nicky, I'm sorry.
We can't help him if -
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
Yeah.
Want me to take this for you? 
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Oh, come on.
I don't - 
Yeah?
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Sure did.
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Okay, yeah.
But I saw something...
Thank you. Very nice.
Ginger, honey.
Get lost?
Okay?
I love you.
You do?
Here.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
'Go! Go! Go!'
They check in alone?
I think that's it.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Two.
Get up.
What's takin' so long over there?
But he never talked.
Go fuck yourself.
Angelo and Buster.
Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here.
No more! You see? Watch!
Fuck you!
Oh, sorry -
Having a good time?
Sorry, sir. The Cult is my life and my life is the Cult. By God, Captain God, I shall not fail you..
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
In women?
I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
A couple that battles the forces of evil together is a couple that stays together.  Thank you, Jeff.
She has a real spirit.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Even the skylight?
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
Why am I still troubled...
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
I'll put that in the report--after you shoot her.
Now he'll be up all night...
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
Men, huh?
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Most articles focus on the first half of her name--describing some feline monster.  I want the woman of Catwoman. After all, if it was a man dressed as a cat, the story would be on page 23--just another loony. Oh, I want this one. I want her bad..
I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
Ah!  You scared me!  How did you know to come here!  Have you been spying..
What?
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
But I'm blind.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Trust me, you won't have to.
Where do you think you're going?
This is one way.
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
Then whose is it?
You could've killed us.
Yes sir.
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
So Theo and Nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  A thing of beauty. Jesus, the shit you come up with!
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
Make a "U" and go back.
What do you keep making me out to be?
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
My name is --
Because you know you'll be killing us.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
Just hang on.  I've got a life of my own.
They say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. They all wear the same uniform.  Please.  Be careful.  The man driving the car must have a gun.
A woman?
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
And that was the end of it?
A price on everything.
I can hear you again, clearly.
I'm trying to.
What do you mean?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
No.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
That's coming off.  How about the girl?
You're all three of you in that van?
Yes.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
Include me in that.
There isn't any such person.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
I thought it was inspired.
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
You wouldn't --
Stop talking like that!
Ask them.
The money, Nels ... ?
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Take your hand out of there. Slowly.
Who is this?
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
Keep talking.
A large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  Temescal Canyon parking lot.
It should take me twenty minutes. Where are you coming from?
Some loyalty.
Take my number.  When you see me -- call me and I'll walk you through the exchange.  It's 308-9962 -- Repeat it back.
Beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
You'll see her.
I still don't see you.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
My pleasure --
I won't let 'em.
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Put the girl on.
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
In your dreams.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Thanks.
I'm sorry.
How?
Did he?
Yeah?
What do you think his name is?
I would expect he does.
Stop it, Dil --
Saw it, Dil.
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
It's him, isn't it?
Cunt.
Jim, Pat, Mick, what the fuck. Long as you remember you're not at Lords.
She's not that either.
It's a simple question.
Scottish?
Who's she?
He's Scottish, Col.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
God no. I'm a hairdresser.
What look?
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Tell me about him.
Shouldn't I go?
Like you're concerned.
Want to look after you.
Dil --
Don't call me that.
Shut up.
That's a start.
Ask to meet me again.
Know what, honey?
So they do know.
Delirious.
Kind of.
Yes.
You could say that.
I'm not sure.
More than that.
Anything.
Sorry. What you doing?
For me.
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
I was trying to get out of something.
My pills...
Jimmy?
Did you hear me?
Stop it, Dil --
More what?
Never.
Fergus.
Will I see you again?
Do you want some food?
Suits you.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
I told him.
And do you know why?
Peter.
I'm sure.
Who'd you think it was?
Should blow you away, you know that?
A hotel?
Right.
Yeah.
Can't.
How is it a farce?
Am I?
I can smell her perfume.
Nope. Not handsome at all.
So I've noticed.
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
And you know the funny thing?
I didn't even fancy her.
Absolutely not.
Ever see hurling?
How different?
Well then, you're going to have to take my dick out for me, aren t you?
Don't be so sure.
My special friend.
But you fellas never get a break, do you?
I've often wondered how you do it.
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
I'm sorry.
A story.
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
Tell me, Jody
Nice lady.
Shut the fuck up, Jude.
First her husband, now her -- she hoodwinked you! She batted all them big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - like a egg from a tall chicken! Here!  You want? Here -- it's yours!
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
How was I leading you on?
What about it?
Well -- come on.
Relax -- you're gaining.
You're going to look for him -- now?
Why?
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Can you remember anything at all?
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
But I don't have it.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Were you followed?
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
That's not Carson Dyle.
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Oh. Then who's this one?
Me? Why me?
Agents.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Me?
Reggie?
Would you like to see my passport?
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Maybe.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
Alex --
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
No --
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on?  What a nut.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
What do you mean?
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
In money.
Here's ten.
No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
Stop it!
I don't know.
I know.  I'm sorry.
I wish you wouldn't.
Is that all? Can I go now?
And this? And this?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
I found it! I found it!
We won! We won!
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
The man and the woman are married --
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --  And if I don't find it --  Those men going to kill me.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
How can you tell?
Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
Not my imports.
Dad ! Most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to.
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
I thought you'd be pleased.
Run!
No. I'll handle this.
Are you sure?
You know where I can find her?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.

No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
He's a rapist. Like mine.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
You watch. There's going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark Shale.
What party?
Ok.
Why?
What?
I'm fine.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
What?
Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Hi princess.
You can ask me anything.
Who is she?
Attacked how?
And the police did nothing?
The principal?
Who was the fourth?
Are you Jody?
Just thinking about something.
I got to go.
I'm worried about someone.
No, you keep one.
No.
Told you to hide it.

Am I missing somethin' here?
I did not steal this truck!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
All right.
Okay.

Well, then, that means it's call...

Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
You're fucked, man.

EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.


He must've had a damn arsenal in there.
Jake, for Christ's sake.
That's right.
What?  Oh, damn near yes. Unless the animal's sick or something.  And the steam rising off it like that in the morning. That's life, Mr. Gittes. Life.
I think I gave it to her.
Do you know him?
Where from?
When was the last time?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.
With her mother.
What is it?
That's all taken care of. You see, Mr. Gittes. Either you bring the water to L.A. or you bring L.A. to the water.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
No thanks.
Where's that?
Tell her later.
Thank you...
Oh yes.
No.
No?
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
How did she...  ...happen to have them?
I don't think about it one way or the other. But if you want, give me a day or two, and I'll get back to you. Now I'd like to go home.
Why do you think Mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? Evelyn Mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the Oak Pass Reservoir?
C'mon I'll show you.
What for?
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Yeah.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
Do you know where she might be?
A private investigator?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Yeah. Fine, thank you.
She's cheating on him.
No reason.
No. I'm just a snoop.
No, not for that one.
Another satisfied client's wife.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Before this I turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, I didn't think there was a thing to it.
What dam?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
You bastard.
The police?
What about?
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Sure.
What are you saying?
She's my sister.
I'm all right.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Oh no.
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
Hope so. He's working for us.
I cut myself shaving.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
So how are you, Morty?
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
It's not completely dry.
Mr. Gittes...
But...
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll do that.
He's not in, Mr.?
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
Yeah.
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
I'm working for his daughter.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
But you don't have any kids!!!
No...
It tastes wonderful!
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and all the saints help you. But coming back! The saints stand there watching you, that's all! God's will be done.
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
For what?
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
And I never asked for one! You have nothing to explain. I always thought that what you did was right, and that was that. With no beating around the bush...  Only one thing made me suffer: bolting the door shut before going to bed at night...
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
Go on!
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
You know why?  She was so -
He made an awful lot of money.
Certainly not.
Yes.
There is no news big enough.
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
I made Miss - Miss Alexander send you the note.  She was a little unwilling at first -  but she did it.
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
Charles.
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right.  He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
In the water.
No.  But you're close.
But you like me, don't you?  Even though you don't know who I am?
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Oh, me -
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
Love!  You don't love anybody!  Me or anybody else!  You want to be loved - that's all you want!  I'm Charles Foster Kane.  Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me!  Don't expect me to love you -
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
All right.
He was dead...  That's a poem.  Do you know what it means?
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Look out that window.
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
I'll get you some coffee.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
I couldn't possibly live on as little as that, Charlie.  We'll let the salary stay where it is.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
Sure.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
I wonder -  You put all this together - the palaces and the paintings and the toys and everything - what would it spell?
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
Queer?
Well, thanks a lot.
Oh, I don't know.  They'll clear all right.
The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
Am I sure about what?
What is this, a poll?
What the hell is that?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Nobody can figure it out. And the boss doesn't want to pay the electrician to fix it, because the electrician owes money to the video store.
And you said yes?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
And you came here to what? To comfort me?
There's more, isn't there?
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
You lie.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
Let me take you out tonight.
I hear that's a rather popular date.
I'm just kidding.
Um... okay.
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
What time was this?
We did.
Nobody. It was closed.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
I can pass!
This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it.
Yeah.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
Return of the Jedi.
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
There's more?
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
This guy is going through all of the eggs. Look.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
What kind of show?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Can you believe this?!
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
We're not playing in the street.
One ball!! They come all the way here... I close the damn store... for one ball!
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
If you go, I go.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
Bible truth.
My cousin? My aunt found him. On his bed, doubled over himself with his legs on top. Dick in his mouth. My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.
What, your dick?
Listen to you.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
Why should I loan you my car?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
I'm happy.
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
I'll read the book.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
Shut the fuck up!
What responsibility?
Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
Same time. What about you?
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
Helluva day.
I know I can bench more than that!
Yeah.
While you two were dating in high school. We're talking four, five years ago, back when I drove a Trans- Am.
All the time. That girl was like a rabbit.
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
Veronica.
Lasagne.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
Actually, that's his night job.
So I'm told.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
Hunhh? Nothing.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Including you?
Twelve.
Including you; yes.
You're a pig.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
You!
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
It's important to me, Dante. You have so much potential that just goes to waste in this pit. I wish you'd go back to school.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.
Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.
I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you understood.
Let it go...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.  Hi, Randal.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
I don't want Caitlin...
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
What's this?
He's your cousin?
Swear.  Olaf, metal!
Yeah!
Oh yeah. You were the built older guy with the black Trans and the big...
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
No, I wasn't.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
He didn't ask me to...
Says who?
Twenty bucks.
Bye. 
How yo doin', Gabe!
What?
More bang for the buck.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Fuck you.
Hal will have my head for this.
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
Love's a killer, isn't it?
WHEN SHE'S SAFE!
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
There wasn't time for anything else.
Fine, I guess...
Is it really four thousand?
Sure you can.
Nice and easy...
Patience my love, patience.
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
Jess--you look good.
He can handle it.
I only came back for you.
What are you doing here!?
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
You know me, I'm a night person.
I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
You attacked me.
Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
Breathtaking.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Next time, date only basketball players.
What?
Never
Don't let me fall!
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
Never could save a thing.
No, he's gone.
What are you talking about?
Anyone else following?
Tucker and Walker.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Then it's a deal.
Ask the questions.
There, what's that place?
I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
Then go fetch.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit? Georgie rises.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
You bastards... bastards.
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The Police beat me up, sir. Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
Won't you join me, sir?
No. She's dead!
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the bloody hell do you want?
Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in some very serious trouble. He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
Just a manner of speech, sir.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
Oh, aye, aye.
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
C of E, sir.
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Fair hair, sir.
Lice?
Vitamins will it be then?
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak. Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it please... please.
You're not cured yet, my boy.
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
Four in this block, sir.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Travel...and things.
Big case?
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
Comin' over Coldwater.  Goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  You believe that?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
I think...
Tell me.  Has Black Peter already crossed off a few bad children?
Twenty five?
Very generous.
I don't know...
Take him down.  Save Richard Yip, our witness...
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Jesus.  Two in one night?
No harm done, ma'am.
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Max!  Dammit!  <u>Answer!</u>
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
Two minutes to get on Broadway. They're doing some roadwork around the bridge.  Eleven to get downtown.  Four to the Lower East Side.  Six to clear the roadwork.  One minute margin for error.  My math says twenty-four.
Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
Max.
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
I'm trying...
I tried it.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
It's a mess.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
I'm...what?  Sorry?
I listen to classical.
I never learned jazz.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
Yeah?  What happened?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Why?
In case <u>who</u> checks?
You tell me to start a union, I'm blowing your head off.  Quit stalling and get out of the cab.
Who?
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
Some living.
What'd they do?
Then what are you?
What happened to you?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
Excuse me?
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
The guy came right at us!
Drop me off here!
Do you still ride?
Motive?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Nothing is easy.
Do they have a secret handshake?
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
This would be it?
I've been reading up on it.
Uh huh.
Is this your dad?
You watch me, don't you?
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
Thanks.
What's in Connecticut?
Come on.
What about you?
It's up.  Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
I can't promise you anything.
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own.  Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
I'm not sure what you mean.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
I'm leaning toward no.
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
Excuse me?
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
Tell me about it.
And Jonas?
What?
Yes, sir.
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
Tell me.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
No doubt.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
You were right, Ellie.  You were right all along.
I don't understand.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
What would you have me say, David?
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
This is how you see the sky?
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
You want to classify prime numbers?
Okay.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
We thought this might make things a little easier.
We don't know.  Whoever they were, they were gone long before we ever got here.
You have your mother's hands...  There are no tests, Ellie.  We don't sit in judgment.  Think of us more as... librarians.  Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
The librarian... or the library...?
That's my girl...  Lights.
A page-break signal.  A period.
It's so... small.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
I do.  More than anything.  But I am also a realist.  Soon this... what is your charming term -- ?  Dog and pony show will finally be over, and I will go home.
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
Jesus --
Peter.
Like it or not.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Only a tiny bit.  Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
Now you know.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
It's getting late...
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Please --
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it?  If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave.  Now.  Please.
It was quite a page turner.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
What is it?
Git movin', I said.
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
I'll make it a dollar.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
Boss, you don't need reasons to hit me.
I... I... I...
Git to work!
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
Pair'a nines.
I call.
'Bout two hours left.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Get away!
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Bears gonna be walkin' the road today.
Cuter.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Cuter.
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
Fear of what...
A little homeopathic cure for the willies.
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
When was the last time you washed your hair?
No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
Reminded me that I used to be attractive.  That men used to want me...
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you really want her help.  I mean if you really do, leave them.  Let her see them.  I'll see they're safe...
You get me out first.
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
That Klutz.  They send him back here, I'll kick his ass good.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
You're calling me a crank?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
How did you know they were stockings?
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
So far nothing they test for comes up positive.
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
You're exhausted.  Let me get you a brandy.
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
That would be much appreciated. Thanks.
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it...
Is there a phone booth there?
Go and look for a note.
I know, baby.  I know.
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
Oh, I know.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Yeah, but she had divine guidance.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Helen... excuse me, we...
Am I in charge of this thing?  Or not.
Right.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
You got a suspect...
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
No, she can come in tomorrow... gonna want to know a lot of things...
She left you, Nikko.  She's not your responsibility.  She takes very good care of herself.  If she wants to romance the kid, it ain't your business.  Your business is to snap out of it.
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
Vaughan isn't interested in pedestrians.
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
James.
It's not here. Maybe the police are still holding it. Their forensic people...
Are we imagining it?
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
Hard to say.
No, thanks. I'll go with Vaughan.
You could get your wish at any moment.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
What?
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
What about the engagement party?
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
Ecru.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
You've only known Jake a few months.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
Tomorrow?
Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
I've already made arrangements.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
You took bets on my diagnosis?
I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
Paul.
Good God.
Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
What are the delusions like?
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Your family just met me.
Aren't you ever quiet?
You like it?
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
No.
Shhhh.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
Thanks.
That's Mr. Beast to you.
Are you OK?
I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
It wasn't exactly a lie.
Why'd you tell?
I think I should call someone.
Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I guess so.
Well then why'd it happen?
What do you want to do?
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
No, it's not like that.
Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
That's a big question.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
Sure, I understand.
I'm glad you're doing well.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
You killed her!
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
It's Elvis...
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
I heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
I assume you want something?
Half the tapes.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
How about if I call you?
And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
What about the money?
Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.
What for?
We'll think of something.
No.
Better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
What do you want now?
What?
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
Hard to say.
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
You didn't say find them. You said, "get them."
Good song though.
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
The Holiday Hotel.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
Oh, then we will have the house wine.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
What the hell is he talking about?
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
It's yours. A gift. A gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
I know where she went.
Oh, you think?
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.
Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put it in yours.
I don't know.
Take a nap.
The lucky ones.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
That's why we're only breaking one arm.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
A little?
You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Why were you spying on the Yus?
I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
I'll never live as a thief!
I have a guest.
My friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.
Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
How so?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Give it back!
My comb!
Give it back.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
It has.  How's business?
I left the training early.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
I am.  He has always been our greatest protector.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
A murderer?
A female criminal!  Now that's news!
What does it say?
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Care for a hot dog?
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
I saw it, too.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
How 'bout the morgue?
Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
Who?
A remembrance.  A closure.
I think he's yours, now.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
Mom tried to cook.
Murderer.
I don't know you...
Take the dope, too.
You don't even remember...
I can see her.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Does it hurt?
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Leave me alone -- !
Fine with me.
Very well, it's your ass.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
That's right.
You what?
You didn't show it to anybody?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
Junior.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
You did?
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
It's not really important.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
What'cha reading?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
You implied it.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
Give it up.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Who?
How about tonight?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
How was your date?
What are you doing?
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
I will.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
You must take me for a real idiot.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
No.
That's not fair.
I think that's for the best.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.
I love you.
I'm sorry about that.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Okay.
Best friends.
Something awful happened last night.
No.
Well did you like it?
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
You think he'll like it?
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
You promised to let me kiss you.
Same time next week?
It works a little.
You do?
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
What, nervous I'm going to win?
Baby?  Right on time.
Jesus!
I'll be in touch.
Likewise I'm sure.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Okay.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Yeah.
So what went wrong?
Where'd she go?
It was... Fantastic.
You wanted an answer to your question.
I accept. Now get out.
And if I don't?
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
Annette! Annette!
I did?
Excuse me?
Don't worry about it.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
What do you mean?
Oh, lots of times.
Sometimes.
But it's already come true.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
I forgot I had it on.
Times have changed.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
We've got to go on.  Amy, here, all this time, you've let your mother and father think you had forgotten that old dream life of yours. Now we find you've only kept it secret.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Yes, I did.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
Voices from an old dark house!
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
In the garden? Would she be there now?
But...
No.
You called me by my name.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Whenever you want.
This is more fun than just pretend.
That one's an elm.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
That's a fine-looking ring.
That's the clever way to do it.
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
No, thank you.
Why hasn't he got a head?
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
My daughter died long ago.
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
Now, I don't know Amy --
Little miss, you can't stay here. You've got to come with me.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
Yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.
Your lips look delicious.
It's not just in my head.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Anything's better than Mark.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
Maybe he's just shy.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
And she got the medium.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.
Give him the tampon test.
It is so hot in here.
No they're not.
You fucked Carlton? See I told you he liked you.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
I haven't gotten it yet.
He's been here all night?
I could smell another woman on him.
Hide him.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
Guess she never found true love.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
About Mark? Carlton?
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
I'm not really hungry after all.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
They say sex is great for cramps.
I didn't have to pee then.
Knock what off?
So pee? Here?
Take your shower.
Your desk.
No?
We... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
Intriguing?
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
I can forgive you a bestseller.
Oh my god, by wolves?
I'm so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
What's that supposed to mean?
They do? Oh no...
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
What? Is there someone else?
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
We didn't have sex.
Oh my god, what happened?
Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
No, I said it was our first date.
No, take it.
Take some allergy medicine.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
And you think I'm sick?
You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she's not here. Let's check out her psycho ex.
The park dude was missing an arm.
This one walk you home too?
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
How will we interrogate them?
He's seriously disturbed...
I'm afraid so.
I see...
I didnt requisition a secretary.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
What is going on?
No.  Have a look.
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
Just let me sit here for a moment? Ill go soon, and stop bothering you.
Yes.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
They're dead, John.
That's easy.  You...
What?
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Yes, Bob.   Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Fine.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Mild stroke?
Up and around?  Soon?
I was a senator, you know.
Is that everybody?
Clean.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
Are you out of your mind?
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
I don't think so.
I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Don't do this.
Dave -- I'm working.
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Oh, yeah... probably...
I'm afraid so.
In the car?
I see what you mean.
I don't think so.
What?
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
It's just five minutes.  She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Fine.
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad.  It's really embarrassing.  But it was Bob's idea.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Yeah... Sometimes they do.
Really?
No.
Certainly.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
I had a feeling.
`Bleed for your king.'
No thanks.  It's not that far.
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Anybody would have done it.
I don't know.
You1re leaving, too?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
Truman used it all the time.
It's just so strange...
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
What?
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
... Me, too.
Dammit...  I told them no mayo.  See - - I could veto this Simpson Garner thing, but I really don't want to do that...
Uh, yes, sir.  The Monroe Hotel...
We're working on it.
What about the intro?
It better be.   Last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
All set.
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Nooooo. Believe me. There are no others...no rebels...nobody...it's over...it's ooooo....
Come on.
SIDDOWN, YOUNG LADY! I DONE YUP A SHIT-LOAD O' FAVOURS AND I AIN'T NEVER YET ASKED FER NOTHIN' IN RETURN! NOW HOW'D YOU LIKE TA SPEND TWO WEEKS UP T'THE VEGETABLE FARM YERSELF? THAT'S WHAT IT'LL BE IF YA DON'T SIDDOWN AN' SHUT THE HELL UP!
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
We're only about a quarter-mile from Cave entrance number five.
We got a boat.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
PULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Leave me alone, you...COCKSUCKER!!!
And you're the one who builds the bomb and they says, 'I hope it'll never actually be used'.
You better not mess with me, Rhodes. I'd love to serve your balls to those Red Coats for lunch! Think about it!
Hey. Slow down. What is it?
Need what? Civilised order like we have down here? Christ!
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
In the battle, sir.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
I don't think they're in school.
Cameron, what is the matter with you. You act like they're your mother or something.  You afraid of them?
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Oh come on, Pitts...
I thought I'd be spontaneous.  I mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Yes... sir.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
No.
I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
It's not all right.  Come on, Dad
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Ridgeway High.  How's Henley Hall, Gin?
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
My Word
Oh, Captain, My Captain. Is there poetry in math?
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
I didn't know you taught.
Courtyard?
A madman.
A crazy madman.
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Isn't there an easier way?
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
Screw it all.  I don't give a damn about any of it.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Father, I have the main part.  The performance is tomorrow night.  Father, please.
But different.
That's miles.
Forget it, Pitts, you're coming.  Meeks, your grades hurting too?
Todd Anderson.
I'll take him over mine.
Nothing.
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
What is that supposed to mean?
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
From my father and Nolan.
I will be with thee straight.
Do you have to quit the play?
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
How soon can we get up and running?
I'd say that's a pretty good assumption.
Shut up!
I don't know...
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Quite a few.
On the side!!
Right... You have a boat.
A meat locker.
Yeah...
Right...
I don't take orders at all.
So?
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
Me??
Good! So maybe he also know where the hell am I going to get the parts I need...
Joey...
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
How does an island sound to you?
You're beautiful what you're jealous, you know that, Joey?
Poolside?
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
What?
Good... Pass the beer.
Get the boots.
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
Fuckin' A!
John,we're going huntin'.
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
They did not!
Jesus, it's freezing!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
It's Nick!
Well... you remember Cynthia?
Vince thinks... you know...
She does not!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Jesus!
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
No.
You are frightened, no?
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
No.
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
No?
Sal's alive???
Here.
Biederman, yes.
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Linda... Hey, Linda...
Linda, Linda...!
No.
That was nothing. That wasn't anything.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you, I'll kill 'em!
Playing.
Who the hell knows!
Yeah.
So do I.
It's ahead, Vince.
I'm doing that too.
What do you think?
We what?
Three bullets -- minimum.
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
Nick!... I thought you went home.
No!!!?
I gotta get back, Nick.
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Phantom Mary?
It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
That's who.
No.
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Yeah.
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
I just... would like to say a few words... about Merle. I guess Merle always wanted something... I don't know... better. That fucking guy, he saved my Life. He saved Sal's... What Merle liked, he liked things right... But then there wasn't any place for that... that he could find.
Up.
Down.
I can smell it.
Wade's here.
Kimberly!
Later.  I want Doucet first.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
He's not that old yet.  You've lost confidence in me.
Out of the room.
That wasn't your plan, was it?
You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
He could be brought back.
Simon Doucet.  You are under arrest. Please come out with your hands in the air.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Telephone repairman.
Shut up!  Drop it.
Not the 'T' word.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
My insurance won't cover it.
Bacon cheeseburgers.
You can't catch this man with a computer.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
I'll be okay.
Good night.
Not too good.
We're partners, aren't we?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
I'm signing off.
And you should be with your family.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
From over the mountain --
No, Jabez -- your place is with your wife --
We will --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
He lied to me again.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
You're wrong, Mr. Stone. There are people who live and die without e'er seeing it. They can't see the country for the money in their pockets -- And some think their state's the country, or the way they live is the country, and they're willing to split the country because of that. Well, I hope you'll meet all those, when you're grown. You'll meet the fire-eaters and the Circassian beauties -- that's part of the fair, to be sure. But if we'd had to depend on them, in a permanent way, the country would have stopped at the Allegheny mountains.
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
That's just too bad --
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
But she is -- I've taken her place. Don't you remember -- you wrote me a letter. Mrs. Stone was too ill.
Belle.
Don't say that -- I know it is --
Opportunities?
Oh, you know the old story -- the Hessian wagon train that was ambushed on the way to Saratoga. Some of the gold has been buried under your barn!
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
Well, I'll be -- 
I'm through with you.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
Shall we?
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Now look -- here's a list of the people I invited -- they're all the right kind of people -- or did I miss anybody?
Coming.
Jabez!
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
I don't know, Jabez.
Jabez!
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
I dunno.
Yes -- I was getting the seed -- I stumbled -- I saw one of the boards warped up a bit -- and -- there it was.
But it's true. Take 'em up in your hands, Mary -- feel 'em -- they're real all right.  Aren't you glad?
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Wouldn't profit him none.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Hullooo!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Oh -- it's you again. What do you want?
Pretty good -- that's perfect!
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
I object.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
So, why didn't you come?
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Mind if I play some tunes?
John.
Tell that to Mr. Takagi.
Tell me about it.
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
What does he want?
Hey, I read the papers, I watch 60 minutes, I say to myself, these guys are professionals, they're motivated, they're happening. They want something.  Now, personally, I don't care about your politics. Maybe you're pissed at the Camel Jockeys, maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland, that's none of my business.  I figure, You're here to negotiate, am I right?
Hey, business is business.  You use a gun, I use a fountain pen, what's the difference?  To put it in my terms, you're here on a hostile takeover and you grab us for some greenmail but you didn't expect a poison pill was gonna be running around the building.  Hans, baby...I'm your white knight.
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for?
They invited me to the Xmas party. Who knew?
I told you...
We may have some problems.  How is your schedule?
When you're hot, you're hot.
We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
Pomona!  You'll be in the car the whole time...Look, let's make this easy.  I have a spare bedroom.  It's not huge, but the kids would love to have you at the house.
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
The plastique I found.  Is the building on fire?
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
Roy?
Bullshit.
This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this?
I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
Don't call yourself fat.
They're not after you, they're after me.
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Well, how'll I get home?
It's okay... it's okay...
I love you.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
I'm sorry...
What trip?
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
Shit...
Where are they now?  Just tell me... are they on the phone now?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
Do you still want the operation?
Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
I'm not alone.
Call me Sonny-boy.
One word.  You won't find it in the phone book.
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
I'm not ... I'm not ... you're gettin' a bus ... you're gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into Kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the FBI guy ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him!
I can take care of that.
Believe me, I'm on your side.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
They look like good kids.
We like you, too.
Why not?
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
My body?  What for?
Dead or alive?
Get over there!
Have him walk in backwards.
I'm here.
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.
You follow my car. 
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
They're beautiful ...
Yeah - it looks real official.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
What'll you do?  Come out.
Oh.  Run.
No!
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
Yesterday I received an e-mail from a source. In this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit California driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
<i>I'm gonna kill you, Ed.</i>
Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you, not tonight.
What?
<i>I won't forget this, Domino. I'm sorry it turned out like this...</i>
That bitch called me a bitch.
I'm pulling up right now. Evacuate the fucking van! Plans have changed! <b> EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT
Yes.
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
Take us to Vegas.
No. Please enlighten me.
Nice to see you again, Edna.
I said stop it.
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
Hello?
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
You have sixty seconds... here's the question...  Which one of you is Frances?
There are no bond certificates.
They're gonna edit it together out of sequence so it's more exciting. <b> EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
Real good.
<i>The tough get going.</i>
Real fast.
Yes?
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
So, in other words, you are not down.
Jade, I still love you.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
We're not hanging out.  I'm being escorted back to work.
I don't know how he does it.
Mother Sister, you've been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
You're welcome.
I didn't.
That's it?
How old are you?
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
What responsibilities?
Stop tripping.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
Sorry, comb got caught.
It's a motherfucking shame.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
I got no say over people.
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
Make dat money.  Get paid.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Then we'll do something else.
I am a man.
Later.
That's what I think.
He's nuts.
Sez who?
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
I like Mookie a lot.
Tell Vito.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Tell Pino.
Actually we have something for you.
Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
A field trip? Maybe I'll join you. See you tomorrow.
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
A-ha! I had a feeling it was all a fake.
We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
Come over around seven.
Ooh gross.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
I'm fine.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Very good. Back in a jiff.
Of course, she's in on it too. Don't let her see you. Just go get that chest and show the world what Collins has been doing. I'm staying here.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
It could be anything. You're going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
Home school. Til today.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Shift to your left.
You brave soldier.
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
Sounds like a pirate.
Exactly! A pirate!
LLOYD, she's my mom.
Will not.
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
Don't look directly at him.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
I'm kidding! Of course I'll be your partner.
I think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
You have beautiful eyes.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
Yeah, that's why I asked.
Am not.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
Roger that, Wilco.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
Right.
Damn! What are the odds?
That's the one I wanted.
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
Hey, where'd you go?
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
No.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
You're just jealous.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Skateboard.
That's the downside. There is none.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
Will that be on the midterm?
So miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you've snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. Whose wearing the Coconut bra now?
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
Sure you can. We gotta nail this guy. You'll be fine.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
And...?
Well I've got a little surprise for you.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
JESSICA. Are you sure?
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
Nothing.
I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
Is this what you seek?
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
Yes...
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
No.
Always.
Bless the Maker and his water... Bless the coming and going of him.  May his passage cleanse the world.
What do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
What is it?
Did they try and fail?
SILENCE!
Those sounds could be imitated.
It is my home.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andtruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
Eh, that was a terrible production. Renfield was a drunk!
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
BULLSHIT!  I am ready now!  Roll the camera!!
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
Well... can't I play the romantic part?  I'm tired of always being the bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary, I played Romeo!  I would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
Eddie, you screwed up.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
That's fine, Eddie.  All in the line of duty.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Soon, Bela... Soon.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
I don't know.  Where?
This is the big moment...!
Ed, it was only one review.
Since I was a kid.  My mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  It just kinda became a habit.
Oh, just like in the script!
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
That's ridiculous.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
I wanted you to say, "No!  I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
Like <u>what</u>?!
I told you this was gonna happen.
So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
You misunderstood.  I gave you everything I have in the world: Three-hundred dollars.
No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
That's not true --
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Mr. Wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
Just, it doesn't look like very much.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
Okey-dokey.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
Are you a fruit?
So you're not a fruit?
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Because he's <u>my friend</u>.
Um, I guess --
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Not good...
I just picked them up on the way over...
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Okay?
Uh, atomic energy?
Dynamite --
Yes?
No!  I don't want you to show the movie, I want you to be <u>in it</u>!  See, maybe I should explain: We started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  So we're having a backers party, to raise some more money.  Perhaps you'd like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
I don't know.
Yeah...?
What octopus motor?
I do.
Mr. Wood!
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
NOOOOO!!!
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
No you're not!  This marriage was never consummated.  I'm getting an annulment!
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
Do they show it?
At what point?
Yeah. Ma...
Yeah, so... ?
No.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
This guy.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
Good luck.
Really? They were..
Who?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Right, right...
Yeah?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No! I -- All right, look, if you hear from Ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
Mm.
Oh my God!
Could've been a nurse?
It was horrible. He called me up.
Why? How...
Hm? I'm, uh... Why isn't this drunken woman you?
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
You batted or you bunted?
Can't we just --
Yeah. I mean for months I've been seeing you with Ray you being his girlfriend and I kept wishing you were my girlfriend... But, you know, what could I do?
I know, I ...
So?
Somewhere.
What?
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
Thumbsucker!
What?
What's the dif --
Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her
Who's Shari?
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Good?
Yeah. Why?
That's the point -- this could change things.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You know you're a sweet little love maker...
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Yeah, just --
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Hey, that's super
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Looks like Tim Kobza.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Yes?
I've got an idea.
Take as much room as you want
Oh yeah, you bet.
Uh, Jim?
Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
I have proof.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Should we get a what?
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Three twenty-five.
You're there.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
Me?  I took advantage of you?  You hugged me!  You kissed me!  You're the one who --
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
What do you mean?
Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
For what?
What do you mean?
Don't you fucking knock?
What'd I do?
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
Yes.  But do you know?
Yeah.
So tell me about it.
This business, Captain?
Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
What work?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
What was that boyfriend's name?
Stens?  Was it Stens?
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin.
Let's just kill them.
Which one are you and which one am I?
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
At least not anymore.
<u>Lynn</u>.
Me?  You called it.  I got a message that...
A lot of bad stuff happened here. It's as good a place as any for it to end.
I spent years trying not to live down to mine. 
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
And?
In my car.  Blackmail shit.  The trunk under the carpet.  Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn, looks just like Veronicaaa --
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Answer yes or no.
Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
I'll break them, sir.
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
What's this all about, lad?
I want you to follow Bud White.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Hold on... We need to canvass. See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight.
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
Bud White's been here?
Why's she seeing Bud White?
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
Why?
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Right now, before I back down.
None.  Call it a hunch.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Yeah, it's subtle.
Something good?
What's he doing here, Sid?
And Reynolds?
Where'd you hear that?
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
Please hold, Sergeant...
And no one'll know about this?
Showbiz.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
Oh Jesus.
Don't know. Did you check everywhere? Maybe it was hidden in something. Maybe there was someone else--
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
When can you get it here?
Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
Be careful, Danny.
Rachel Banks?
The NSA?
Wait.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
I called my wife!
You told me no calls.
How'd you have the manpower to--
Why'd you leave?
Tell me about it.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
<u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
Listen--
No.
How fast can you learn?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Well then who can?
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
Can you help me?
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
Eight.  Size eight.
Okay.
Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
<u>What's</u> your point.
What kind of trouble.
I'm not his attorney.
Because I don't know.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
No, sir.
Listen to him.
Just for the criminals.
Something bad happened tonight.
I saw a man die.
Yeah.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
It's okay.
How could you let me find out like this?
Robert--
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
It's not real...  That's not me.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Stacy--
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
Stacy...Stacy...maybe now isn't the best time for the I-Told-You-So speech.
That's okay.
You're as bad as Eric. I've got an entire family of people who root through--
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
Oh.
It tastes like fish.
Not that much.
Yes.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
Eat your fish.
All right, look--
We're screwed.
Yeah.
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
We have good reason to believe that he passed you--
We'd rather not--
My shoe?
Oh, well, that's true.
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
Good point.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
What are you talking--
Can I open 'em up?
Do I know you?
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
What about jewelry?
The blender?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Bobby--
Bobby--
Bobby--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
I need help.
How can I reach you?
Are you still in Crystal City?
You remember Daniel Zavitz?
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
Fuck you.
You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
There was a transfer.
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Hiding something?
I just meant--
You're kidding me.
What's your ETA?
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
Yes sir.
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
Hello!  Good morning.
I don't care to bargain.
Excuse me?
Pardon?
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almsy nods.
What?  No!
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Shall we be all right?
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
You will.  You will.
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Yes.  Absolutely.
You too.  Good luck!
Appropriate?
Sorry, what's your point?
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
Her hands and feet were tied.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
In my room.
What's the matter with you?
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
Just kiss me.  It would mean such a lot to me.
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Oh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.
Are you Hana?
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
So you can shoot a pistol?
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
Please don't creep around this house.
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
Me?
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
Off with his head!
What?
Apprentices.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
Candaules
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
Because I'm a nurse.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
Really?  That's sudden.
I've been told that before.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
Yes, for your hair.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
He's sleeping.
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
I had a hotel room.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
What's he saying?
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  And now this.
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
Bingo.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Then don't.
You're joking.  You can't trust anyone these days.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
Possibly.
That's my girl.
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
We're only going one way.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
Good morning.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
We go underwater?
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
That's because I wanted them to!
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
No. It's a down payment.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
It was a long time ago.
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
In eye of that painting.
You're not on the beat.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Ready.
Behind you.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
Yes. Yes.
There is no big job.
Okay, 80-20--
Hold the record. Alone.
I always knew you'd do the job.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
I'd taken the Mask?
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Transfer.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
And the money goes--
A parting gift from the Empire.
We're doing it tonight.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
Can't be too careful.
Charged.
Call it a new tradition.
It was wrong to deceive you.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
FUCKING THING!!!
The disc is still in there.
I sincerely hope not.
You can do it.
I'm not leaving without you.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
Because I never assume anything.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
It better be worth it for me.
Remind me why.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
What do you think?  What's this?
Who?
Which one?
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
For what?
Any school you want.
Yup.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
If you hadn't used profanity --
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
So you think we got 'em scared?
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
They skipped that step.
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
You didn't care about my case?
They're trying to intimidate us.  Tell them to wait in the conference room.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Reasons PG&E thinks it shouldn't go to --
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
I'm not gonna fire you.  I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit.  You embarrassed me, Erin.
Uh-huh.
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Erin --
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
You see your office?
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
Right.
How come you're not eating?
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
We'll see.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Why not?
How?
I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
I'm just saying --
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Thinking.
What's that?
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
That's okay.  I understand.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
What's going on?
<u>Excuse me</u>?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
You're clever.  I'm sure you'll think of something.
Next week.
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
Yes?
He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
Ben ... Ben ...
I feel The Force.
And that is why I must go.
Growls a reserved greeting.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
Sit down, and shut up!
If I may say so, Sir, I noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
Han, we need you here.
Yes.
What was it?
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
I take it back.
I'm against that.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
How do I look?
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Never heard of that system.
A mining colony.
Let er go, Chewie.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
I always said you were a gentleman.
I'm sorry too.
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
Good.  It would be most unfortunate if I had to leave a permanent garrison here.
Take them, but I'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
You're part of the mining guild then?
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
There's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the East Landing Platform.
What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
Wait a minute.  We're not going back there.
Are the coordinates set?
That sounds familiar.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
What did you say?!
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
What are you talking about?
I've never seen it fail.
But I feel The Force flowing!
Only what you take with you.
Free your mind and return he will.
It is the future you see.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
No!
Time will tell.
They're...pretending to dress.
We know that.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
I mean that in our 'primitive' civilization, apes just don't talk. I mean I think it's important that, when our 'primitive' security precautions are lifted, the first time you say something in public you should talk to what we 'primitively' call the Right People.
Now go get dressed. We have things to do.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
What?
Where's Plissken?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Don't lie to me.
Dream on, blue eye.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
Cahuenga Pass. Make your way up through the mountains toward the Hollywood Bowl. You should be able to pick up Utopia's tracer there.  Once you go inside, you're on your own.  You know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  We have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
Yeah, I got it.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
Don't like it, don't come.
Yeah. The place kept changing owners. Finally went bankrupt. That thing in Paris killed 'em.
Are you crazy?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
The what?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Who?
You're running out of time.
Give me the prototype.
Yeah.
I cannot--
...I saw nothing.
--By itself it is only a piece of steel. Its power comes from he who wields it. For now there is no one. Do as I have ordered!
Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
Speak of the devil!...
You are the son of King Uther, and the fair Igrayne... you are King Arthur.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
In the great book.
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
I know. I have heard noises and echoes through the stones...
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
Well hurry then, and get it.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
--Nothing!
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
I will run.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
Can it truly be used for magic?
I'm not jealous!
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
Shh... yes, yes. Sit with me, please... Morgana.
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
Doing what I did for you, it wasn't easy, you know. It takes it's toll. It took nine moons to get back my strength.
I?
You strike me with words as hard as steel.
Why it's perfectly plain, your the teacher at the college, you don't want the building torn down.
Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
Hi, how'd your day go?
What's this?
No kidding.
Why don't you let me?
What didn't he tell you?
Storage.
No, she was heavily sedated.
Please.
Really? wow.
You're a nice man.
Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
She is going to be well?
What man?
Never.
Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
No.
He didn't mention her.
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
No I wouldn't. But I'd try to persuade him to turn himself in.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Could you see her?
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
Oh, will you help her! Just help her!
Like what?
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
Are you sure?
No
Father?
Um........Stuff.
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
The closet
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
I don't know
You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
Do you not like him like daddy?
Okay.
That's his office back of St. Mike's. He's our psychiatric counsellor. He had a pretty rough knock last night poor guy, his mother passed away. She was living by herself and I guess she was dead a couple of days before they found her.
That's good.
So what's next?
Stealing is a sin.
Who's in it?
No.
I'm not Regan.
If that's true, then you must know my mother's maiden name. What is it?
Intensely.
You and us.
La plume de ma tante.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Uoy era ohw.
Uoy era ohw.
Okay
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
Amen
Defender of the human race...
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
I've seen him.
Only what I read in the papers.
From the psychiatric end.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Are you a relative?
Yes.
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Swimming trunks.
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
You bring trunks, Jack?
They're falling out.
No bones?
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Recognize these two characters?
My pleasure.
What's the point?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
You got weird kids, Frank.
Why the interest?
It's more than that.
Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
It's not family.  It's business.
I don't know what you mean.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
What?
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
It's early.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
Yeah, fine.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Okay.
Right.
Yeah.
Doesn't it matter to you?
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
Two hours ago!
He was wearing a suit.
Celebrating.  Join me?
Right.  The Royal.  When's the last time we were there?
Yeah.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
Twenty-eight years.
Seventy-one
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
It wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
I'll take the Mallory.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
I can keep the beat.
Yeah.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
Spur of the moment.
Just call me a cab.
All right.
All right.
Right.
Impersonally.
We ran long.
We're a team.  We work together.
Changed?
What's he talking about?
Am I missing something?
Hey!
Time for what?
My wife wears a seven.  You don't look like a seven to me.
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
I was gonna split it with you guys.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Maybe.  I'll call him.
He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
Huh?
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
What?
I'll call you.
I'll call you.
Baker.  Jack Baker.
He doesn't bite.
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
It's been a long time, Ma.
His kid's sick.
The Stratford.
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
You want me to walk you?
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Guess I got a little scattered.
Practice.  There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
How do you know?
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Huh?
Oh.
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
If I see him.
Hi.
Sounds big.  What's he do?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
I guess it's getting serious.
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
Yeah?
Sure.
Fine.  You?
You look great, Castor. Really.  Here -- I got a shot of your favorite -- Mescal.  Even has the worm.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
How old is he?
Yes.  Pollux bought one along with the original batch.  Obviously, he found a way to make more.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
So you had a nightmare.
And you wouldn't be.
One last time.  It's important ...
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
She doesn't know -- and she never will.
Don't worry.  I've done my homework.  I'll get Pollux to talk.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
You've given me the freedom I haven't had in years, and the power to make it pay off in ways I never thought possible.  But hell -- this is America.  One day a pauper, the next day, a prince. And I owe it all to you. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got an important government job to abuse, -- and a beautiful wife to fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean "make love to."
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
You'll be seeing a lot of changes around here. Daddy's a new man.
You haven't changed at all! Some guy tries to rape me -- and you side with him!
Well, I saw you -- Kim.
What happened?
Yeah -- it's Santa's Magic fucking Village.  Your present's in here.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
Gone?
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
I'll have a talk with her. By the way, you never said anything about last night ...
-- Studying.
Back then -- who wasn't?
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
Im sure you do...
I dont think youre hearing me.
Whats going on here?
But I think I like you better this way...
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
On a case by case basis...
Sure.
Check...
Like what?
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ringing my bell...
Maybe I dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
I dont think so.
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
Its your birthday? Today?  Whats your name?  Where were you born?
Ive got all the time in the world...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here.  I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
Damn, you are the real thing...
I don't do that.  That's just not for me...
Everyone needs something.
I've got everything I need.
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
I dont think so, thank you...
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Maybe youre not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
Okay, chief.
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
For us, Kate.
Yeah...fine.
I dont know!  Please stop yelling at me!
Party?  Oh no, I cant go to a party...
No, shes not.
...my feet are hurtin...
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
She got those shoes...
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
No, I love Annie.  We had a lot of good times, didnt we?
You had a heart attack?
If you want to look at it that way...
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...  Hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?
Oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...Im gonna take you to that special place...
Wait a minute.  Youre my wife?
No, open it...
Zeena...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until its light out.
Thats all I wanted to hear...
Its like a museum.
Think bigger.
I dont think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  Well put Annie and Josh in private schools...
This is New York City, its like the needy people capital of the world.  Those Jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Jesus, Jack...
Jack.
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
A shelter?!  Im the richest guy in the building...Ive got twice the square footage you have!
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
I'd like that, too.
So we'll get egg nog.
Merry Christmas...
Yes!
Tell me.  When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then.  You didn't listen to people.  So why start now...?
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
Relax, it's casual.
My step-dad's.  I'm strictly into stone.  I was wondering when you'd walk by.
Youthful high spirits.
Five times.
He's made a few changes.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
'Course not.  Strictly business.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Give me the god damn mirror!
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
I'm worried about you.
What is this?  Where's Reed?
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
I'll schedule the launch.  Call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew.
Victor did.
And they're changing into...
What do you mean "complete"?
Ben, are you there?
Oh, it is.
This place is deluxe.  You got cable?
But all these people...
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Johnny.
I think that thing is Ben.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
And if he's not...?
Showtime.
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Yes sir.  You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
You remember in school we talked about working together.  That's what I was about to explain...
Not at all.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
So reel him in.  But we came here to do a <u>job</u>.  So let's do it.  <u>Quickly</u>.
Reed, we're running out of time.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
I was talking about us.  Working together.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
Great minds think alike.
What about you?  You haven't eaten in days.  How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
You <u>were</u>?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Victor, are you feeling alright?
It is.  There's something we need to talk about.  Something I need to ask you...
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love.  To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
Message to Proteus.
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
That blip we're picking up might only be the radio-active particle. The Proteus may already be destroyed...
Here's the Surgeon.
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
It's only for an hour --
Yes?
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
We must!
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
But big enough for us...
You may learn to like it.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Well, if you happen to be very fond of him -- even in love with him -- it would certainly affect your point of view.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
You can't believe all that's accidental? That there isn't a Creative Intelligence at work --
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
It I can clear this Central Nerve, that <may> be enough...
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
On the Repeater.
Yes, by all means. We must try it.
Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
I don't know. Few munce.
...What're you talking about?
What?
HOLD ON! NO FUCKIN' WAY! YOU FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH? I GOT FUCKIN' SHOT INNA FAISH! I WENT'N GOTTA FUCKIN' MONEY! I GET SHOT FUCKIN' PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH! I'M TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR! THAT FUCKERZH MINE!
The new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
My wife! What the - how's -
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Mr. Mohra?
I unnerstand.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Uh-huh.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Oh, yah?
Oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
Okay. And Scotty, is he gonna be all right?
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
Huh? Yah?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Yah, I see.
I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here. I'm cooperating... There's no, uh - we're doin' all we can...
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Well... I'm goin' ta bed now.
You told me about it.
I know it's a lot.
I thought you were gonna show it to Stan Grossman. He passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah.
Yah.
No, no. I - I'd, I'd - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I'd go - one over prime -
I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
Well - it's cold, Margie.
Yah.
Yah?
Oh, yah?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
It's okay...
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Yah, is this Marge?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
No.
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
We've got a -
Love ya, Margie.
Yah?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
Yah, ya think?
Oh, fine.
No, no.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
Congratulations, Jerry.
We're still men.
...using steroids.  I was a juicer. Diabonol, then, Wisterol -- it's for racehorses, for Christsake.  Now I'm bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids won't return my calls...
Oh.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
No, I wasn't aware...
You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.
Sure.
I'll expose you.
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
The girl had done her homework.
Let's not make a big thing out of it.
The forwarding number.  I haven't seen you at any support groups.
I've been going to debtor's anonymous.  You want to see some truly fucked up people?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Chloe's dead.
What?
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
I know that I've been... unwell.  I know it's been like there's two sides to me.
What?
You are an insane person.
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
My suitcase was vibrating?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
No, supply oxygen?
...no ...no ...
Delivered from Martha Stewart.
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
Do what you like.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Don't watch.  I can't if you watch.
He farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
You get the idea.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Good answer.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
I said I promise!
I don't know...
You quit?
Newcastle?  Did you start that one?
I felt like destroying something beautiful.
Fight club was the beginning.  Now it's out of the basements and there's a name for it -- Project Mayhem.
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
What?
If the applicant is young, we tell him he's too young.  Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
What... ?
Um, well... technically, no.
I'm not going...
You don't know that.  There could still be people inside.
This is not about martyrdom.
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Proceed with remote detonation.
Fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.
I swear on my life, I won't...
You told me you'd say that, too.
Well, sir, you said you might.
Robert Paulson is dead.  He's dead, because of you...
You and your friend.
Pleeeeeease!
Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
Why?
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
No, please, no, God, no!
The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
I hope you're ready for this.
I...I...
You were there?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
I have to save Eugene!
Random, sure.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Carter.
Blow me.
I thought we were finished with this bullshit.  This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line.
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I've got to stop and help those people.
I'm Officer Burke.  I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz.
What was the fight about?
Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
...My Premonition was just like his.
Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful.
It sounds all well and good, but what if we're wrong?
How do you know?
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
Fix-A-flat?  Road flares? Sunblock?  Mace?
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
Nice try, kiddo.
Yeah, but everything's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming.  Almost like bein' able... to see the future.
I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  I would know.
Like... 4:25.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash...
Let us out!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
Why do you think I was hiding?
You're the fuckin' devil.
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
No one's that strong.
Terry's name should be on this wall.
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
Huh?
What just happened?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
One hundred.
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
I need a vacation.
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
American?
Let me see.
What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
How much we got left in that minigun?
Sure.  I only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
Spooks?
Where's his father?
Huntington Beach, California.
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
Sorry, Sir.
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
You think I'm some whacko?  I like to hurt people?  I'm doing a job here.  If I knew what's right or wrong I'd be a goddamned priest, right?  So I follow directives... I do what I'm told.  It's simple.  If your boy had done what he was told, there wouldn't be a problem.
American.  Come to get you out.
I could take it or leave it.
There were treating me like a headcase.
I say we tape him to a chair.
But now it's free, right?
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
You threw him out?
Really?
It's not funny.  It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
You still believe in God?
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
The moron?
Well, what the hell does that mean?
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
No...  He is supposed to live there?
<u>No</u>...<u>No</u> <u>please</u>...!
Jack, it's a sitcom -- you're not defining Pi.
No, I have to work.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
They're --  -- What?
I'm the one what?
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
God... I'm the janitor of God.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
But I can't get it... He's...
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
You're a true <u>friend</u>.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
You're totally gone, aren't you?
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
The Red Knight!
It's a classic.
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Bingo!
<u>Parry</u>!  Close your pants...
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
I know!
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
Got any Ethel Merman?
What a gyp.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Shhh...
A wig?
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
Well, lemme play the other side then.
You're playing the other side.
Out where?
You can sing the song.
That's right, hand.
Yes.
I'm not some piece a crap.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
Who said I was depressed?
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
I don't, huh?
Fill it up.
How do you know it's clean?
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Would you like to talk to the manager?
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
No, thanks...
Yeah, well, he's...
Where's Catherine?!
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
Of course I do. It's music. You know...
I didn't have any.
At being a fake.
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
Yeah, I think I could.
Catherine...
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
You're all full of shit!
Will you shut up for a minute!!  Pull your car out of line.
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
It is true.
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Hi.
No.  What you do today?
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
Just chill.
Nah, we make out and stuff.
Good. I'm faithful to them.
I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
I can't!
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Pitt.
C'mon.
If we were at 10th Street Pool you woulda done it right in the water, right?
For real?
Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
Yeah.
Wha'?
I'm a good friend of hers.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Jus' from around the way.
By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
You mean her.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
Full name.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Yes.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
One. B-a-b-a-r.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
Oh, he was dying for years.
Just relax....
Just relax.
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
No idea.
Okay. Some idea.
Like tonight.
I'm serious, Sam.
I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --
Nothing. They're still there.
That's it?
What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
I like your outfit. You got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Velma.
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
What are you doing here?
What?
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Come inside.
You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
Sure, all drifters do.
They serve dinner on the flight?
Deal.
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Nothing to it.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
Cute thing.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
John! You used to fly together!
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
None of your business, now go away. You're throwing my game off.
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
Here, take mine.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
What is this?
Why did you do it?
How do you know about that?
I'm talking about how much I'd like to take you to a Laker game.
I checked. There was no divorce.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Cabana one.
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Who are you?
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
Why not? Oh shit... really?
I'd say charcoal.
Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
Utah?
What about finding the source?
Go to transportation, get a ticket.
I want something I can print!
Not really?
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
John!
I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
Of course.
No, I ain't got you...
Who?
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
So you...
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
Thanks, I needed that.
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
I love you, too, baby.  He wants to meet at six.  What time is it now?
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Celebrate?  Like we celebrated after solving the White Bluesman murders?  Forget it, man.
Yeah, let's bury her.
What are you doing at the office? You wouldn't believe what I've gone through tonight... I'm calling from the Mega Beta Pogo Sorority.
I've always said the one reason I'm the best detective in the industry is that I'm the only one... but hey, I never throw away a clue...
Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
What?
No.  Who's Art Mooney?
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
People still watch that?
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
As Clark Gable said to Ava Gardner in Mogambo:  'Fuck the purse, we're gonna die-e-e.'
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
Good news is that yeah, I found him.  The bad news is...
Shut the heck up... Pop.
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Oh, but I am.  Dianetics, Ford.  You should try it.
Yeah, yeah, I know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  Shit, just start torturing me, man.  I didn't even know Johnny had a disc and I can't deal with any 'Don't play games with me, Mr. Fairlane' bullshit.
Are you okay?
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Oh please, Ford, I'll do any --
Only on a first name basis.
That's funny, you're cute.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
Mr. Doyle.
What?
Coming in this week, week after. Everybody going to get well.
Where do you want it?
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Yeah?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Who's this --
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Pour moi?
Je n'ai jamais vu tant de srenit. Elle m'a demand de tes nouvelles et si nous tions heureux.
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
J'ai pas confiance en lui.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
Yeh?  Who else?
Marseilles.
Willie Mays.
Where the hell is it?
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
Hey, I thought we come for a drink.
He was the bank on that shipment outta Mexico three years ago.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
Yeah.
We put him to bed for the night.
I say we keep sittin' on Boca.
Just for mistakes of parking?
For garbage?
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
So what?
Nothing.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
The usual.
Sure.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I gotcha, I gotcha Chief!
Luck, my ass.
Hello, Frank.
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
Huh?
What'd you just say?
What's happening?
Johnny...?
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
I'm thirty-five years old.
I never knew you, Dad.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
No Dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
What if the radio stops working?  Christ, what if I can't reach you again?
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
You there?
Yeah, I think so...
It's not your fault, Dad.
Okay, okay...
Sully!  Is that you?
Gordo?
Yeah.  That's it.
That wasn't luck, Johnny boy.  That was smarts and ten plus on the job.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
Sounds good.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
You work too hard, John.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
I mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
You can play with yourself, 'cause I'm going in the house.
I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Chuck... look.
This is all the exercise I need...
Will you come with me?
It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
It's deceiving.
The quiet can fool you.  It fooled me.  You can never be sure of what's out there.
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
May be please have the wallet.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
I admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
I could swear I heard...
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
All he's asking is for you to check it out.
Are they grown-ups?
We'll scare 'em right back.
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Will you listen, dammit!
Yes, but they released me because...
There's no time for this bullshit...
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
Eight times.  They've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
Yes.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Then maybe I should offer it to your daughter...
I know everything about you, Diana.
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Maybe you should mind your own business.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
That's what I'd like to know.
Absolutely.  The church even sent me an autographed picture of God.  Ward!
Oh my God, Steven.
Sorry, I'm working now.  You see, I have a job...
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
Okay.
About what?
No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
He bought you that?
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
Ask me in about five minutes.
Nothing.
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
No.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
No, I think it's just the beginning.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Where is she?
Oh dear God...
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
What are you talking about?
I don't think that's such a safe idea
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
But Sean said...
I...I can't...
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
Really?
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
About four years ago...at Crystal Lake. I spent a few summers there with Uncle Charles inbetween boarding school.
What is your location?
Hi, Sean.
I'd love to.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Press a button and they give us money.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Do we care?
I say we go.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Where is it?
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
There are things that speak to us from the past.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
I talked to her two days ago.
You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
Packs an emotional wallop.
A flat-out hit.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
How prominent?
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
She's my gynecologist.
What did it say?
It's me. Nicky.
I know, Pop.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
So what are you going to do about it?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
What am I doing?
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
Alla puttanesca.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
He goes to the theater armed.
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
I'm sorry.
Well, we shall try.
Did they take your clothes?
It does. We must be getting old, Charlie.
He said he's in charge...
Hm. And what should an "important professional" write about your response to General Smuts's new legislation?
That's right. The word only means "community." But it could stand for "village"... or the world.
Even as a boy I thought so.
A great deal.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I mean a day of prayer and fasting. But of course no work could be done -- no buses, no trains, no factories, no administration. The country would stop.
No.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
It's over.
It's for the best.
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Luca could still be an accomplice.
Often.
Thank you, no.
This time I will supervise each test personally.
Jerome--?
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
At least you're honest.  Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
Wrong color.  It's silver.  It's not easy living up to this.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
How long do you stay up there before you go?
What are you talking about?
They found my eyelash.
I'm sure I could have.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
--We didn't want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
I've found him too.
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Come on.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
Get it over with...
No way. I've got to get out now.
Assumed name... Houston.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
After four years and now the question comes up.
I'm still here, Doc.
It's all right.
Really.
Better than I remembered.
I laugh when I feel happy. Sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. I had a lot of that. And other times that wasn't enough. I had a lot of that too. I know you find it hard to believe, I'm happy just loving you.
There are three men dead.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
Fifteen minutes.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
El Paso.
Twenty eight hundred.
I think so... I don't know.
You want to try with me?
You and me.
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough and I'm goin' home.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
Where?
Just sandwiches...
'Bout five thousand.
You serious?
How about twenty thousand?
I'll tell you when.
I know.
How?
This is my brother's car.
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Why?
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
I can't Jack. How can I?
On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
He was all right to me.
Nicer than most.
Yes.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
You bloody whore. Frank was too careful to die like that. Who killed him?
Oh, do you?
We're there now.
What girl?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Your brother? What you talking about?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Yes.
Thanks.
What?
Yes.
Right.
Went to school with him.  He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
Large Scotch.
How'd you find me?
You sure?
No. Really, I am.
Up the stairs, Keith. The door on the right.
Ta-ra.
They came back?
Pension him off.
What's that supposed to mean?
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
Yes, thank you.
What, and get myself beaten up again?
And that'll make me feel better?
It would be. If they were still living.
I've always ad your welfare at heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm nosy.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Yep.
We've got to take you back to London.
Shut up.
They do that up North.
Knock it off, Gerald.
Some contest board...
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Eh...?
Eh?
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
What?
What?
What do you mean?
What? 
No, we're just...
Yes.
As a robbery.
That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Is that what I said?
You have to go in.  You have to get the leads.
Yes.
...they take me, then.  They're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
You went for it.
So I'm making it concrete.
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
Yes.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
Huh?
That's...
They stole the phones.
To the cops?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
No.
Do you understand?  My stuff is mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm taking half of his commissions-- now, you work it out.
In school.
I'm sure that we're insured, George... 
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
I'm going to the Chinks.  You're done, come down, we're going to smoke a cigarette.
What two?
...do you want to go downtown...?
Not lately it isn't.
Let me...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
Yes.
Twenty percent.
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Now.  Yes...When?
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
I have to go... 
What does that fucking mean?
Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  You hear me?  I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
I don't know what you are saying.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
What does that mean?
You sold eight Mountain View?
That's right.
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
From the store.
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
Like you taught me...
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
I just put Jim into Black Creek...are you acquainted with...
Sure.
Home cooking...
No, his wife is.
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
To change our minds.
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
Yest...
I don't know.
You tell me again.
She told me not to talk to you.
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
You did that?
Guess who?
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Why not?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
Some of them...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
John...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
I got lots of presents.
No, where is it?
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
At first, like everybody, I was a soldier.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
No.
The children can stay.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
But, you told me yourself...
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
Beautiful.
What?
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
I'm going to see my parents.
Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt?
If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead.
Wait... there's something else.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
It was a boy.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
Alright.  I'm going to go outside and talk to Fredo.
Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere?
Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number.  And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up.
No questions.
Did my brother go back?
That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
We'll keep it quiet; the people who know are trustworthy...the Committee needn't find out.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Yes, Michael, it does.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all.  I never thought that could happen, but it has.
It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out!  It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil.  I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world.  An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
Very impressive.
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
Let him gamble.
I deny his every charge.
That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock.
Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
All right, then let me say you'll pay me because it's in your interests to pay me.
Keep them alive.
Sitting right behind you.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We got no choice.
Maybe, yes... maybe no.
How much more a month?
Just thinking out loud.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
The Master is waiting for you.
Tea is fine.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Of course.  I am married still.
He is dead now, twenty years.
No!
He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
Just that I was in the Marines.
Just got away from me.  Sorry to disturb you.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
Huh?
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Broke is more like it.
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
You don't say?  Which picture?
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either.
Go ahead.
Did you now?
Did anyone laugh?
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
But we have to match the other sketch.
I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
Something happened to him?
You're the one who started it.
If that's okay?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Catch my death.
Good.  Let's get dry.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
I see.
The Great War?
Your friend?
What won't do?
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Oh Clayton.
Hasta la vista, Boone.  And give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
I think I'll hang around.
Good.  Fine.
I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
You only embarrass yourself.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
More your line.
Oh dear.
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
Sure.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
I don't mind.
You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?
Of course.
Righto.  Let me see.
Head.  Not heart.
Sit?
About your brother. And the deeeep shit he's in --
Tell me about Kip -
A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
Me, too. Every time I walk...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
I knew you'd say that.
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
This is number 50. We did it. It's over Where's the money ?
You got no choice. It's over.
Get out of here, then. Now.
Kip.
You know my back.
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
Honestly? I want to - once every few months - get into my car. Pack a lunch. And drive on up to Chino. On visiting day. Bring you some magazines. Maybe some almond clusters. And see you all bright and shiny in your orange jumpsuit. That's what I want ...
You know my back.
Cadillac.
Needs brightening ...
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
The other day....
You got a school teacher or Nancy from accounting, you don't put on Sly Stone or James Brown. You put on Ravel. Rachmaninoff. But if you got some wild one you just picked up at the track, you wouldn't put on Cat Stevens or James Taylor. You'd put on Prince. Or Isaac Hayes. Or, if you really wanted to get after it: Miles.
C'mon, man ...
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Hey, Donny --
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
We don't -- ?
No.
Of course ...
Kipling was sixteen when you left, baby. I don't know what you remember of him. But you should brace yourself
NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
Yeah -
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
Me.
Me...
Not really ... But you know... Maybe I'm wrong ...
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
Maybe not. But Dad was from another era...
Price of doing business...
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
I know ...
Thought I'd go for a ride -
No problem -
Now, we go -
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
The hip, cool, sexy thing was getting old...
No can do. Life goes on, pointfive ... You left me, remember?
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
Six or seven...
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
Okay.
I always thought you'd follow me up.
No way ...
No. I had a girl. She was great. The problem is: great girls come along once every ten years. So I gotta wait another three years before I can even bother to look...
Shhh... Car thieves are your weakness.
Cut 'em...
Wrong preposition...
What's that?
He's gotten involved --
Who's "Eleanor?"
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
Not really -
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
No more shines, Billy.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Oh I Him.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
He watches it for me. It's better than waiting at a garage.
What are you gonna do?
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
Paulie was just talking about him.
Jimmy.
I gotta talk to you.
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He heard.
My father got a letter from the school. He said the next time he'll kill me.
I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
I got dry cleaning.
Suck my cock!
Fuck you.
Next week.
Why not?
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
Let's take a walk. EXT. CHUCKIE'S STREET -- DAY
Yah, all right...
I told you, I just got change.
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Shut the fuck up.
Fuck you, I did the body work. Whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
Good, it was all right.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Which one's your building?
What're you doing?
I think so.
An integer.
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
So am I.  Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I wish I never met you. Because then I could sleep at night. I wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. And I wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
It's a Carlton Fisk baseball card.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
Yes.
Yeah, cured polio.
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
I need someone with your kind of background.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
That would be fine.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
Now wait a minute, Gerry--
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
He's not you!
Come in.
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I don't know. India maybe.
The boy was here. He came in, sat down and we worked together.
I don't got a crush on her.
Yeah, Morgan. I got fired.
Like what, Will?
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
I did.
No.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Yeah.
Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Why is it a cop-out? I don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'. Or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. There's honor in that.
You're not going to fail me are you?
I used to go with the wrench.
It's not your fault.
It's not...
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
Good luck.
What?
Okay, sounds good.
What?
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
Hey, I spent all my money on those caramels.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Your house must have been a zoo.
We'll do that.
Aah, it's kind of a hike.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Some, a little.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
No.
And you're sure about that?
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
I'm not honest?
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't *nobody* else a-goin'! We *got* here an' we gonna *stay* here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us--  --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
You're *ticklin' me!*
Naw. They paroled me.
We got to get outa here right away. Ever'body here? Where's Uncle John?
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Fan-belt's shot.
I guess that's what he looked like.
Okay. Go on.
Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
But--but how we gonna eat?
Which way is House 25?
Got a warrant?
An' you say no cops?
Say, who runs this place?
Anything like work aroun' here?
Why, you're the preacher!
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
You're right!
Casy! What you doin' here?
I dunno. Payin' five now.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
I hear it. I think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. We better get outa here.
Little trouble up ahead, but you'll get through. Just follow the line.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
You mean I can't even get outa here?
You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
No'm.
I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
We *got* to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy.  Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
Granma's dead.
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.
They killed Casy first.
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
Good-by, Tommy.
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
Won't they come out here?
Why, she wasn't no more'n a kid when I went up.
California, here we come!
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
We gonna take whatever they got.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Now don't you go monk'ing--
I never--
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
Wonderful.
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
Really...? So what?
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Really?
Overflowing with love.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Here is now there. There is here.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
Bad people.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
I'm staying here.
I'll hide.
I just know.
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Out Loud?
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
In Portugal, yes.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
See you next week.
I'll do it tomorrow.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
Jim?
I spoke to your father the other day.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
Yeah. I guess we did.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
Does Chicago count?
A jogger, huh?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
You sleeping all right in that house?
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
Need a lift?
Feel good?
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Ssshhh...  Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
The point was to love each other.
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
I don't care.
Fine.
I didn't know I had to.
I don't care.
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Then why do you want to leave?
No, you just act like you do.
Did you go riding?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
That's not true.
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Did you speak to Farlow?
Exactly...
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
I love you.
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
I know. We miss you too.
What do you mean?
Oh, I don't know...
We have a business manager. The best around.
Either fight the way things are or accept it.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
She calls him Tommy...
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
You!
Diane!
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
You know her?
We should be fine, then.
Twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Sure.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
We already did the river. Let's go down and across the old bridge. We can circle back.
OK, OK.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
Maybe... look -- just...
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
We still have a way to go.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
What do you mean?
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
Again?  Yeah sure.
Super hero like even.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look...  "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Yeah, mom?
Blow me.
I told you, I don't play well with others.
Razor and Blade.
And judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
Are you challenging me?
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
It's my subway defense system.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
Man, there's too many garbage files, I need more time.
I'm trying to help you.
Gill.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
What's happening?
Joey, Joey...
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
Hey, it's me.
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. I traced the hacker's call. The secret service picked him up this morning. I'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then I can eliminate it.
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
Congratulations.
Nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
All right.
This morning.
Don't get angry.
We've been better.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Its too late.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Al here lost his boy 10 years back.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
I don't want to.
You ready for some Ice Cream?
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
Well I don't want to seem desperate or anything.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
He's been here.
It isn't a man.
We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
All right. The Wallaces leave at seven.
Fun-ny. See you.
I have a place for that.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Look where?
I wasn't spooked.
He was watching me.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
Annie!
I can't.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
Come with me.
Lee Brackett.
Not since 1963, since it happened. Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
Could have...
The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
Totally.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Hi, Tommy.
See you.
Tommy, let me in!
What is it, Laurie?
You're coming with us...
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
Are there any special instructions?
Only minimum security.
He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
Mm-mm!
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Well, let's do it.
Look at this.
Oh, is that what it is?
Right.
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Okay.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
I cry at the opera.
I'm an architect.
It's terrific!
Uh-huh.
Well...
Like what?
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Hi.
Uh-huh.
Well, are...are they big?
Ed Smythe, yes.
Could you--
...cannot go on the air.
Oh, great.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
No?
Oh, yes.  Who doesn't?  Look!
No, I don't think so.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Yeah.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Why, you know the situation.
What do you expect me to say?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Poor Hannah.
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  I-I-I want to do things for you.  Hannah doesn't need me as much.  I'm being presumptuous.  Not that you need me.
No.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Are you angry with me?
Always.
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Mm-hm.
Because he likes you.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
They're in the basement.
Oh, Frederick!
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
Oh...
You know... 
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
I think they're fantastic.
Why?
Oh, me, I'm okay.
No.
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
He's fine.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
...from Mavis, also.
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Oh, sure.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. 
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Well, I just came from an audition...
Yeah, that's clerical.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
I remember you.
We didn't hit it off.
How are you?
Oh, no.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
I am.  You-you made my day.
Oh, who cares?
Oh, don't be silly!  No!  Don't be ridiculous.
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
...which I did not get.
Hmm.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
They're offering... 
I <u>swear</u> to you...
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
You want me to be?
Rich, comic book freaks.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
And who is "they?"
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
Then I'm doing fine.
I know her by the Back.
...I have never met a man who was so well beloved.
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Have the child taken to bed.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
Exactly.
Mmm...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
I can make you rich.
...she couldn't act on her own..?  Where is the FBI's vaunted Initiative, where..?
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
Enchante.
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
She my foster.
No. 
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
Spoken like a Protestant.
Thanks to <u>you</u>...
...and my need for The Institution...
And how did he do that?
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
I want the <u>same</u> drink.  Cause it did me <u>good</u>... but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like another.
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
...<u>what</u>...?
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
What shape is the scar?
Well, that's you see, what I am, kind and feeling.
It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native Florence.
And what does <u>that</u> mean?
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
I..
...why?
That's when you went to the Orphanage...
And you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this Hat, and...
...yes...?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
I can be a good pig. Babe. Charlotte's Web. Good pig. Watch.
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
You are the prince of the darkness.
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
You're all making me blush...
Your Secret admirer?
Goodnight.
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
That wants to be a Yes.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
Clever observation. Go back to Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't.
Yeah. And?
Ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Don't worry, you...
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?

That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
Oh Ronnie, you have to look at what I dug up the other day.
Shoot.
Ronnie!
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
You're beautiful.
Like last night, Veronica?
Uh-huh.
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
Color me nauseous.
God, I'm so sure. Don't blame me, blame Heather. She told me to haul your ass into the caf pronto. Back me up, Heather.
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Uh-huh.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
I didn't. Cherry.
I don't know. Should you?
Time out....Jason Dean. Your Pop's Fred Dean Construction. Must be rough. Moving place to place.
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
"I die knowing no one knew the real me."
Next channel, darling.
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
You must have had fun.
Did not.
I was just making it more special.
Phase my ass! You'll be <u>back</u>! I'm storming Normandy beaches and you're running in place with Pauline Fonda's airhead peacenik exercise program. Have to stay tough! You'll be back.
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
No-o!
You didn't say Simon Says.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
What?
I thought I...you..
Let's kick his ass.
Shut the fuck up, all right.
Heather was cool, but cruel. The good looks and bad manners gave her power, but it could not give her happiness.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
Is it hurting, dear?
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
I'm not hungry.
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
Open this door!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
Thank you so much!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Somebody's got to help us!
What??
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
Yes . . .
Mummy!
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
You just made that up.
If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
How many zeros was your wife worth?
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
In a word? Lucrative.
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
I'll just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why you've disrupted me at work.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
How much do I stand to inherit if Kirsty is presumed dead?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife.
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
You must have been very proud of yourselves...
What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm way the fuck up here, I'm scared a heights, and you want me to deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on it for Chrissake!
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
I got your bail continued.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job.  You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
Mister LaPlante...
Spanish kinda guys!
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
I wouldn't be depressed about it, Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic to be a human being.
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
Why doncha let me in so we don't wake everybody in the neighborhood?
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Yeah.  I'll see ya... dad.
JOEY!
All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
Bodybuilding!
Unprofessional.
You wouldn't push the guy, would you?
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
Dad!
Never reach out!
He's pretty... remarkable.
What about?
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Who?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
Let's watch some TV.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Right.
I understand that.
That would be stupid.
Who doesn't?
<u>Ask</u> her how she feels.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think I...
Holly -- that's not so.
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
Oh -- great.
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
Philip!  The senior partner?
Not very long.  There have been a couple of bids already.
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Isn't it?
No.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
They appear to be authentic.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
So?
I see your point, Bedsoe, but I have to look at this from the law's point of view.  There's something missing here.  It's something I'm sure you've come across many times in your career.  It's called evidence.  Get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  Find me an eye witness.  Dig up a motive.  Until then we don't have a case against him.
A few days ago.
Central Park.
No.  I don't scare easy.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Who are you?
What?
I'm sure they will.
If it came down to it what would you do?
She's the King's cousin.
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No -- I will.
That doesn't matter.
She's a treasure she is.
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
I would like to say goodbye.
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
Are you a cop?
What do you want?
I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
A lucky guess.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
You remind me of someone I used to know.
Who was that man last night?
New York is dangerous place.
I'm interested in mythology.
You're twenty minutes late.
I wanted to get to know you better.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
So?
And the other one -- he is like you?
It will end tonight.
He will not stop until it is over.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
What?  How?
How could they get by him?
I was working on the cataloging.
I know, Paul.
We'll see.
This cannot be.
That's what the Kurgan said.
Aye -- that I would, lass.
It's not for me to decide.
I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
Why?
If you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  Your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  This room is filled with memories. If you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  And now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. Look in your heart, Conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
Yes, sir.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
<u>Fuck</u> them!  Now get your head in the game, Phil--we have to handle this.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
Stop it!  They found the truck, Kev! They're already behind us!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
What are you talking about?
We had an awful lot of shooting.  You need a doctor in there?
I'm here.
My father.
Use more ice.
I got the gasoline --
They'll cut the power.
That would be Mars Krupchek.  Jesus, he works for me, too.
Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
It won't be a problem.
I don't eat junk food.
What do you mean?
You worry about your end.  I got my side covered.
What hospital?
You'd better be kidding.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
How about dog shit?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stop it.
He said something about a girl --
What are we going to do about Mike?
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
We have a boy on the line.  He says he's Thomas Smith and he's calling from the house.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
You have her cell number?
Don't crowd the house.  The alpha's a kid named Rooney.  He's amped up and volatile.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Special Agent Jones.
Thomas Smith.  I'm in the house that's on TV.  Dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  You gotta help him.
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
No!  They're right here --
How do I reach him?
What do you want?
Your phony FBI assholes.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Where is your family?
Let me explain.
There is nothing to it.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
Yes we have.
Where is she?
What did they say?
Satellites?
The high command? Our high command?
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I'll be over.
They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
No.
No, sir.
I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
I am always glad to see you Paul.
At least.
You have no whiskey?
Take the river road back. It is clear.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
What is it?
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
Thank God.
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
He will be here.
No. But I make cards. Would you like me to make you two cards?
One thousand francs.
I will see what I can do.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
Get in.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Please go back, bring the children to us.
What are you saying, Tatsi?
What for Paul.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Please do not talk like this.
Anais, it is so good to see you.
What's wrong?
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
He has taken the presidential suite.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
What is his room number?
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
And what's Steven's status?
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
Oh dear.
C'mon.
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
I got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
Yeah, me too.
And I think that's case --
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
What?
It's not going to let us out!
Prove it.
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
-- yeah, we did that --
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
Let's try down here...
He's gotta still be down here.
He's dead...?
Run.
Jesus!
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
You're hurting me.
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
-- the sadistic prick --
Asking the wrong person again.
Wouldn't know what to do with it all --
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
I am.
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Why not?
Over here.
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
What's the matter?
It might have been her mother.
Why don't you pass me your plate?
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
Yes.
We're going to go someplace new.
Take me to her.
For good luck honey.
Don't be afraid!
Well, that all depends.
Good night daddy.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
To our family.
I don't know.  That's strange.
Ok.
Are you ok?
Aubrey!
You seem to appreciate the local scenery.
What?
I'm ok.
I'm all right...
We're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  Unfortunately.
Yeah, they told us this was the best.
Did you know her very well?
It was a shame.
I took pity on the poor woman. This house is too big for one person to live alone in...
How can I help you?
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
And what would you do?
Runic?
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
And what did you discover?
Then tell me what to do.
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
I'll do it!
Would you know this store again?
Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Can we see?
I don't know.  Maybe.
I'm sorry.
Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
Not quite.
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
That's so good to hear, sweetheart.  It really is. You know, I .. are you alone?
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Something like that.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
"He kicks up at anything he hears.
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
"How'd we ever get such in a ru-utt"
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Yes way.
Yes, and my giraffe loves it, too...
That's what you theenk.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
What are your plans for the weekend?  Hoisting away the Colosseum?  Tell me, did the devil make you do it or did Darwin and Minerva Mayflower?
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
You know, the place where you gave the bad guys the Codex.... the Mayflower Museum.
You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson.  Right now, you're the only guy.  Without your help, I....
Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking with God.  But you're a close second, tough guy.  What is that smile?
Actually he never told us what it was.
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
I don't care.
We're here to say, your government was right.
That New-York-Italian-Father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch.  What was our bet?  A million?
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
But you're going to tell us anyway...
What job?
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
Yes.
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
Weren't you the bartender at Jonestown?
You certainly do.
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
When it rains, it pours.  Name's Snickers.  The plane leaves in 40.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
You just might.  I'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it.  At the time, I was bald with a beard, no moustache, and I had a different nose, so if you don't recognize me, I won't be offended.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
Employer?  The president?
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
Tell me about it...
Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
Yeah.
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
...Why don't I just type this up...
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front --  -- not that everyone's buying it.
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Now, Aim --
Worked in a watch factory?
Consider this my resignation --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Phony, huh?
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Well, do a follow-up: Hoover: Hero or Mama's Boy? The rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that Idea Man story!
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Says who?!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Terrific.
What the heck they doin'?
It's the most beautiful t'ing I ever saw.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
I --
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
Yeah, but, buddy --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
And Sid says you stole it!
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
You --
Wait a minute!
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
She sits down.
He notices.
He don't look wise.
She's damn good, Lou.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
Where?
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
So -- he says I'm nice.  He's a nice boy, too, Miss Connell, a very nice boy.  But I'm worried about his drinking.
I don't mean believe, like believing in a religion.  I mean, do you believe it has power?  Do you think it could heal a sick person?
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
But you didn't have to come up here.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
Thank you.
Is she a doctor?
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
By a curious coincidence, it's my day off, too.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
Of course not!
Good morning.
Still, I feel you should remove the decanter.  Wes is not an alcoholic yet, Mr. Holland. But as a nurse I can tell you that it won't be long before he is.
I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
Why did you come in here?
I love Fort Holland.
You didn't drive her mad.
She was beautiful.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
I am afraid, Wesley, he has that right.  And I will have to urge him to use it.
Yes, I said it, and I made myself believe it. But when I got here, Jessica was already raging with fever.
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
It doesn't matter what you call it. I can tell you right now Jessica isn't going!
Dr. Maxwell has very unpleasant news for us.
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
Good night.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
You think I --
What do you mean?
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Lab experiments? Right smart guy -- Paul, you know your mother's gonna be disappointed not to see more of you -- In fact, let me make this more than a simple request guy, I think you should...
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
You're boring me. I have a husband. I don't particularly feel the need for another.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Don't bullshit me around, Janey. Jesus Christ, I waited around for more than half an hour, in nothing but my boxer shorts, and -- and what's all that about? What the hell happened?
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
It's not a bother.
It's really quite all right.
Educated guess.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Am I right or am I right?
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
No!
Great, thanks for the tip.
What is it?
You know Libbets, I really feel, you know, like a real connection to you --
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
I dunno. I --
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Greetings, Charles.
Yeah? See ya.
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
Are you his girlfriend?
Vodka?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
That's all, for now.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
Too bad...
Actually...
But there wasn't any...
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
I don't remember.
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
I know.
Why?
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
Where is he?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
No fibers, skin flakes, hairs...
What time was that?
First I need a copy of the key.
I.A.'s calling themselves the "Corruption Task Force."  Can you believe that? Trying to root out any mistakes or "oversights" any other Detectives may have made over the years.  They're turning it into a witch hunt.  Something on the news about it practically every night.
To do nothing.
Cut some kind of a deal.  I heard that's what Flynn's doing...
What are we thinking?
Will?
Don't do this, Hap...
There've been other cases.  Where we've changed results.  Pushed witnesses. Manipulated evidence.  But Dobbs.  I wanted Dobbs more than anything.
After that she left the party to go to him.
What was it?
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
Yes down at the station.
Yes.
Then so was mine...
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Procedure went out the window a long time ago.
We had feared we were the only ones...
Then there is nothing.
Then God does not exist...
We can do that?
Like moths around the candle of the age. Decadent, useless. They can't reflect anything. But you do. You reflect its broken heart.
Follow me - that way - through my cell -
Louis, I can't save her. I will only risk losing you -
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Yes...
Yes.
You are more beautiful than any of them.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
What danger?
Yes...
Then my luck would have changed.
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
I can't do it.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
I want a woman.
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Anything is possible. But just try it for a week. Come into New Orleans and let me show you some real sport!
Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Are you mad????
CLAUDIA!!!
That's all past, Lestat.
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
I tried...
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
If I could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt I wouldn't let it end like this! You need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Who? Who is here?
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
No.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
He's cute...And he's got a crush on you...  But...
Don't even think about it.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
Just kidding.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
No, you're not.
Ray, we're just friend.
It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
Will you try...for me, please?
Tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
Fine. Show me the body.
I'm fine.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Sure. It's fine. As long as you don't snore.
He's in it with Willis?
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
I'll talk real slow.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Hello?
We gotta get out of here. Now.
He's probably the only one who can help us.
We'll call you back with all the details...So what's your favorite radio station?
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
How's the water?
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
That staggering. His dying so quickly.  In your campaigns, have you never seen men who staggered before they died, who talked incoherently  walked blindly.
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Go ahead. I'll wake you up when I go to bed. Then you can watch him.
May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
I have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say, I believe everything, a little.
I just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you.
My friend -- what can one say --
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
I donut understand.
M~ father will take care of it.  Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe.  I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
On my word! That's what they believe.
I don't know now without my father.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
She has never mentioned her family.
In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then - I'll not die  I'll watch - they shall not hurt you.
What an odd question!
My last name is Pherides.
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
How do you know what my father thought - -
Mr. Davis seems a good prospect young handsome, sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
Hero?
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
Thea?
But the war, the army  they need you.
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
The General threatened me.
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Then foreclose!
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Who?
All right  all right.
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Don't . . . George?
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
I said I wish I'd never been born.
No.
No, of course not.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Yes, George?
Oh, well, I can't . . .
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
Sit down? What are . . .
Well, naturally. Of course.
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Not a soul.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Want to give my flower a drink.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Uh-huh.
I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
All in . . .
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?
Came back three days ago.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
No.
Yes  charge.
Don't hurt my ear again!
Aw, forget it.
No. No.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Okay.  What's yours?
Pretty much. You know, George, wish we could send Harry to college with you. Your mother and I talked it over half the night.
She was here first.
Hello, Vi.
Nothing.
Right down here.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
Have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
You like it? I'll send you a box.
I'd like to do that.
What is it  a woman, then? You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.
Well, now listen. I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? And George, I may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan. This is the biggest thing since radio, and I'm letting you in on the ground floor. Oh, Mary . . . Mary . . .
I don't like coconuts.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
Neither am I.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
You may kiss my hand.
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  Am I talking too much?
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Do you like it?
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
Thanks for dropping around.
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
What plates?
Hmm? Well, I . . .
How fast is enough?
I think we're changing course a little.
Back down!
Swim for it!
They're moving pretty fast.
Yee-hah!
I was counting on hours.
You're betting what you already got.
There's a shark....
Want to swim home?
Oh, yeah.  Sure.
It's still there!
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
Not the drugstore!
You can't stop me.
Never mind that shit.  Just point.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
Okay, okay.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
I kind of had plans....
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Did you get any pictures?
All of us thank you, okay?
My ass!
We don't know that, do we?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
So there's one around here.
Why?
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired, that's all.
Mike's out there.
It's still a good idea.
Two of them are still missing!
What?
That's it?
Sure they did....
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Waiting for Andy.
Maybe.
Ready?
Nope.
The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
And second?
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Mike?  Our Mike?
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
It's an island, near here, with a lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out there, you know....
No.
I can go out if I want to.
Name it.
Sean, baby, please....
When are we going out?  You and me?
Okay, okay.  Close your door.
He thought he had a good reason.
Forget it, he won't listen.
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
How many sharks have you killed?
Want another one?
They're acting very strange suddenly.
I guess.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
Nothing.
Up.
God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
It's easier to lure sharks at night.
How's your patient?
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
... Okay.
I'm  fine.
Make this quick!
Well, I have to get this into the networks.  If you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
Calvin, I insist I be allowed to capture it!
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Still sleeping.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
He's missing.
Yeah, from Boston.
Well, wait till you see the rest.
Come on!  Check this out!
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
No, think of something else.
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
Can hardly wait to do it again.
Now what's this do?
I am serious.
Now what?
That?
Hey.
Well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  I say, love, is Flipper ready to go?
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
It's large enough...
Five hundred yards.
You could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
No way.
Right, Mike.
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
I want to see Kathryn.
Don't hurry back.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
That bugger moves fast.
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Yes, I did.
My mother always told me, if God had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we'd have been born with free tickets....
We need milk....
Because....
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
They're at the beach....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Stop what?
Adds flavor....
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
I'm still five....
It's not nice to be evasive.
Mother....
What?
He died from fear...From having to go out there after it....
Don't be such a Grandma...I was always climbing something....
Once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
There's nothing to worry about....
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
Why'd you come out here?
I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything....  I'll get something important done for both of us....
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
I always listen to my feelings....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
Doesn't matter....
If you don't take it, we'll be swimming in a minute.
No!
You're always taking time off....
What?
Won't you get in trouble...?
Give me a hand here for Christ's sake....
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
A shark attacked Thea and some kids...She's going after it....
You got a better idea...?
She said it was coming....
You sure you know how to do this.
I fly elephants for smugglers....
All you passengers are the same.... Complain...Complain....
It needs more time to charge.
Inch by inch....
The readings suck....
Forget it....
They put bombs on dolphins....
You're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  You're never going to amount to anything.
Stop busting my hump....
Gave them the day off....
When we got the grant....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
You don't know shit about anything. Time you learned....
So far..
What?
How long has he been here...?
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
I'm going down, Jake....
Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
'Snuck up on me....'
My equipment doesn't crap out....
I'm training to....
When he has a pillow over his head....
Anything to do before I go home?
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Only me and Mom ..
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
Because, don't get into it ...
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
Listen to me saying what?
I was wrong.
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
Bits.
<u>Hit those wipers, Ross</u>.
Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. See these striations right here?  It's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? Rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I don't see that at all ..
I thought it was Taylor's case?
No.
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
No .. But we have a theory ..
Wrong cabinet.
<u>You</u> put it in there.
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
Yes.
I don't know.
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
I gotta admit, you're one of them. Just wish I knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
Of course I would ..
Hamlet. Have you read it?
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
Do you pray?
Why does he want to kill me?
I know about alcohol, John.
I'm blind because my father drank.
I wanna be near you ...
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
C'mon, Chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. I'm not taking notes ..
Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
I think John, would <u>love</u> it ...
Don't mix very well with beer.
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
Even better.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
He has? .. What's he doing here?
Ask him.
That's right.
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
No no. I knew.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called "my twenties." See you later.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Hi.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
Mission... statement...
Good evening.
Yeah, what happened there.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
Good night.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Why do you love me?
Tell me -- let me help --
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
I'll give it everything.
Said who?  Sugar?
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Mmm.  Hmm.
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
Good deal, man.
Damn right.
Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
Go.  Flee.
Tell me, and then you can sleep.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
You okay?
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
Dick.
Hi Ray.
Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
Funny.
Right up ahead, buddy --
He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much about dinosaurs.
Quiet!
We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and come back.
Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been swimming at the Y.
Nothing.
Just drop it Paul!
No, it's...
Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead. What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. The exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. You can't go beating yourself up about it.
When did you have it last?
Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men, we stick around, huh?
I would completely support that.
I didn't know, there were two islands.
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
The bones will be there when we get back. That's the nice thing about them. They never run away.  And besides, you got me into this. I don't intend to be alone with these people.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
Really?  What do you do there?
Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
Which one do you prefer?
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
Are you sure?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
But then you never get to go in space.
You should.
No we're not.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
Back out! Move!
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
It certainly does.
Like if you shoot yourself in the foot?  Wouldn't matter.  You'd be dead  before you realized you'd accidentally pulled the trigger.
Is that who we're really working for?!  Gene splicers?!
I want to see the nesting ground!
That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
My vacation is over in a week.
That was about a year ago.
To collect my fee.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
You've broken its leg!
Isn't it obvious?
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
Piss.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
She's nuts.
Our chance to do what?
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
No way.
It'll hold!
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Birdshit?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Can the kid walk?
Stop the program!  Stop the program!
The door security systems are shutting down.
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
I'll catch up with you.  You can go with the others.
Oh my God.
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
Good!  Keep going, now.  The cable will terminate in a big, gray box.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
The - - agility.  You're right!
We were right!
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - barfs them up - -
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Okay.
The shutdown must have turned off all the fences. Goddamn it! Even Nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence.
Why not?
No?  Non-linear equations?  Strange attractions?  Dr. Sattler, I refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
In a box under my seat.
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Oh, yeah - - great.
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
Nope.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
There's gotta be something - -
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
What does he mean by "target audience"?
It's safe.
Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Timmy, let go!  You're gonna have to let go!  Count to three.  I'll catch you.
Yes.
Chaotician, actually!  Chaotician!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
I will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, Dennis.  I really will not.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
I'm not sure I'd call them murder exactly. More like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand.
What?
_Krueger_...
Compared to this guy... amateur.
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
So?
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
Yeah, what is it?
That doesn't make sense.
Not yet.
Great.	When can you do it?
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
My client... is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
You have been hearing the sordid side then.
What is it really?
Yes -- we do.
-- Small.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
Not a chance.  I'm the thinnest person I know.
Another one?
What an extraordinary request!
Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
No, I left it in his office.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
Sit down, Kafka.
I do.
No.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
Usually.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
Over?  It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
I -- I found your jailer.
-- Listen to me --
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Eight -- and seven months.
I don't know.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
-- Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant.
That's been noted.  But where does it lead us?  Unless you have something more to add.
What did she say?
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
Then why haven't I been --
... A piece of paper ...
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
Lying in the gutter where they belong.
It usually is.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
Here too!  They're all in a dreadful muddle!
It's ... lovely.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
I photographed it extensively, father.
All in due course, Ann. Our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to London.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Jack!...  Jack!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Yeah.
What about him? Yes.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Please --
Yes?
You've spent your life avoiding this. You'll try hard to deny it; you're quite likely to destroy it.
I guess he figured it was better.
No, that's not --
Mm.
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
What about everything since?
Yeah, you got to me.
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Mm.
When?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
No.
I don't like getting splashed.
I was wondering what that was.
With Trina.
How do you know how bad it was?
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
About what?
I better keep looking.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Someone's been doing all these things.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Look -- dad -- I may stand better with the cops than you.
She told me.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Did she talk about him to you?
Has she talked with you since prison?
Then how are you involved?
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
Yes?
Oh, yes.  Won't you come in.
He's in his room, playing.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to the... 
Greatest...
On earth.
The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
You got a letter from mom.
That's okay.
That's okay...
Oh, for God's sake...Here.
Yeah?
Oh...
Sure.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Why does he decide?
I don't understand, daddy.
Where will my toys be?
Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's?
Six years.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
No, I did not.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
No questions.
Yes...
No.
I...I don't know...
Yes.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
So do you.
Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
Such as?
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
I don't think so, Jim.  Maybe I shouldn't have--
Are you firing me, Jim?
Sure.
But it's not a year from now, is it?
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
I know....I know.
Fine.
Do you want the kid or don't you?
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
I can't tell you how sorry I am.
It's beautiful.  It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Any prospects?
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Three.  And add some basil.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
What?
You and Charley?
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Are you, General?
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
Soon.
All?
Time to study.
Yes, but they say he did.
Yes.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
Answer. 
You could buy them.
No. This war is almost over.
I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
But, I have no experience.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Eliminate you.
We cannot.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
No.  Do you?
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... I think he had Alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one <u>coherent</u> day, he asked me to end his suffering.  I wouldn't <u>do</u> it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that I finish him off.  Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
Mr. Cyr!
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
What the hell are you doing?!!
They don't really attack underwater and--
It came from across the lake.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
That's actually the easy part.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
<u>Nothing's</u> real.  I'm rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
They could try to tranq him on land.
Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Hank <u>says</u> he's sure.
Who?
Skipping stones.  Look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
That's probably good.
Um... y'know...  Yeah.
Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
It's okay.
Ssssh!
Maybe.  Don't mush it.
Likewise.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
You gonna dig up that lady's husband?
<u>You</u> <u>gotta</u> <u>be</u> <u>kidding</u>.
I'll take it!
Did he say anything?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
Was he swallowed?
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
I thought I saw...
You think Jack's handsome?
He said he knew Karate!
Look.
Me too.
The somebody else part?
Else.
It's ten after nine.
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
Kelly--
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Backstabber?
Why does she keep repeating the name?
Why not?
Sometimes.
I don't know! Get me out!!
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
I understand.
Starling -
I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I promise. Be gone before you know it.
Okay, Mr. Yow...
Thanks.
Murdered...? How?
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
He's got a real taste for it now. And he's getting better at his work.
But if he knew we have so little time -
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Let's get some coffee and talk.
They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention...
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
I think so.
May I see your credentials?
Maybe they'll catch up.
All that detail, just from memory...?
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Big through the hips. Roomy.
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each particular thing, ask: What is it, in itself, what is its nature...? What does he do, this man you seek?
What was it?
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
Yes. I'll tell you.
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
We leave in the morning?!
Well that is to be expected. My father...
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
No. I will find you.
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
There was none!
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Yes. Yes, I will.
You know he wouldn't send me...! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this.  I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said...
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
No.
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
Ottawa!
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject?
What else?
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Sir!
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Yes.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Granted.
Be my guest.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
What has?
Were, Doss <u>were</u>.
Can you fix it?
No.
Just get in yours!
All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
Roger...  More light, Sixpack...
After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
The escape bubbles?
How much time does that give us?
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Roger.
Ahhhh!
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?
Beautiful.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Not yet.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Itches like hell.
What music?  There ain't no music.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
Two hundred meters.
The infirmary?...
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
It's had a meal.
Sixpack...
Sleeping.  No sign of Doc, though.  I'll check the control room.  You look in the shower room...
Oh man, that's just great...
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
It's hit us all hard!
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
They were . . .
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
Can I help?
It looks like t, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
Try that one.
All right, Dad.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
No.
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.
OK, open the gate.
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, Tom?
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
He means they're thieving dogs.
I'11 meet you in the car.
A hundred grand.
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I like your bar.
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
You know how much it is, Nick.
You know it doesn't include the amp.
Seven hundred each.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
At what, exactly?
So?
Get your fingers out of my soup!
Twelve.
Er, well, twelve.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
I can't take any more school.
So?
They stole our land--
I can fix cars.
No, sir--
I mean, follow orders, sir.
No, sir. Not at all.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
He'll live.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
We were just dancing--
I'm feeling okay--
You're testing me?
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
You little pissant--
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Do I seem jumpy?
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
He never asked her.
No sir.
But they were Indians themselves.
He's still pissed off about it.
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
Cool.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
Maybe.
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
You know who it was they dug up?
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
Old bullets.  He uhm-- makes art with them.
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
That's where he fell.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
That's right.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Bandidos, Injuns--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
We was crossin' the river--
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Right.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Buddy Deeds--
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
A little older than Paloma is now.
I was too busy.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
I don't mean Fernando.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
You ever play one of these?
He's going to wish he was dead.
Of course you can.
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
What do you think?
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
Well, you were working there--
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
Are you okay?
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
So she tells me three times a week.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
More, I hope.
Two years.
I been working on a few things.
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
You telling me what to do, Roderick?
What's up?
You sell much out here?
Hell of a spot to put a business.
So when did Buddy leave?
Payne.
He's gonna find out.
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
Who?
Nix?
You heard right.
My life was too weird for her.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
About?
Not yet.
I swear... this is the place Swann told me about.  The rocks...
It was me.
Yes...
Yes.
Does that mean...?
But obviously you still care what happens to him.
He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery.
No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money,
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
No.
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
It's okay.
You can't.
Yes.
I think so.
I just saw him.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
He got up and walked.
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
Oh, I've got plenty.
Fuck you.
We've never met.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Mine.
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Shut up!
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
What about?
Not much.
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
Sure.  Vivovich.
Why?  So you can fuck my wife?
No.
Looks that way.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
A couple of weeks.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Philosophy.
No.
Hi, Charlie.
Ok.
I see them every morning.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, you smiled.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
You're possessive.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Because that would be too easy.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
A coke.
Around.
Thanks.
Hello, darling.
Is this a bad time?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
Tomorrow.
Ok.
One moment, please.
What?
Why do you have to defend her?
Good...I'm tired.
Sure.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
It'll just be a few days.
Sure.
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
Bad?
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
No.  Of course not.  Mmmm.  Anago.  My favorite.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
Peter, are you okay?
And how would you describe him?
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
You know I'm not comfortable with this.
This patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
You heard voices, you know you did.
You're right, but it's funny.  All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Everything I did, I did for you.  I love you, Peter.  Think of it.  I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
Kelson, hold on a second...
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
What are these?
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
Not a lot.
It's me.  Put the gun down.  Maya...
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
You are the younger of two...
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
It's Detective Smythe.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
He's looking right at me.
Where is she now?
Nothing.
Dad around?
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
That's ridiculous.
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
Thanks.
Huh?
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Just wanted to say good game.
How's that been?
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Who's Spalding?
Yeah.
You either.
Hey.
Figures.
Yeah.
I said fine.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
The "man" again.
Are you out of your mind?
Few days ago.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
A rest?
Thanks.
Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Something was just missing.
We need to talk.
What?
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
Better late than never, right?
What?
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
Keep your voice down.
Nona, please.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
We still have to go?
We were just studying.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
What?
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Well what's the situation?
Does this sound weird?
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
baby, please, please --
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
Did you hear what I said?
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Who was it?
You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
I don't have a boyfriend.
-- is not my boyfriend.
If you're not here for a 422 --
Good bye.
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Bye.
Well I don't go out very much.
Let's make a deal.
I'm sorry --
Can I tell you something?
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
Claudia.
It's upstairs.
How much time do we have?
I don't know.
-- Richard.
Did we win or lose, I mean --?
Stay quiet...stay quiet, son --
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
It's ok, boy.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
I'm a rapper.
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
Well --
What?
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Don't Donnie. Don't do it.
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
It's...doesn't matter....
Don't do this, Don.
You were gonna ask me weren't you?
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
Do you wanna sit down?
No.
I'm trying.
She went out.  She said she went out to run some errands.  She'll be back.
When was the last time you talked to your son?
Who?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Is this 509-9027?
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
Let's talk about --
In aid of what?
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
She's my mother.
people die.
What name?  My name?
Is Linda here?
About three weeks ago.
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
The door was open, I got a call --
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
No.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
I won't.
Are you alright?
Love you too..
I'm a bad person.
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
No one else that I know?
How long with Paula?
Do you have any children with anyone?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
Do you know the answer to this?
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
Did you ever touch her?
I don't know.
I don't know what I've done.
I'm her father.
Like what?
No they don't --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
Linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
Linda --
Shut the fuck up.
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
818-753-0088.
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
And um....do you have Swank magazine?
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
That's it.
Thank you.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Shut up -- shut up --
Stand up.
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Go to bed.
I understand you saved my son's life today.
And you were not hurt?
That is good.
Then we will both die traitors, d'Artagnan.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
We haven't visited in three years. And we should have privacy.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
He is your brother!
No, Louis!  No!
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
You must reconsider this plan. Phillippe is like a child, he --
But -- what is Porthos doing?
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
It presses us but it is good for us too!  Louis' whims make him more vulnerable.  We are less ready, but so are his guards!
We can't... stay here.  That traitor d'Artagnan... knows about this place.
To the Bastille.  And death.
We have grown wiser with age.  Now we know that some problems cannot be settled with a sword.
You can't do it.
They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
There are more important things than tits.
Forgiveness?
Can't you see I'm praying, goddammit?!
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
What use am I?
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Athos, my friend!
Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
I did not share beauty with someone... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with.
How did you know -- ?
If I could have a blade, then I would be please to run with you.
And you never knew why?
In his mind, anyway, and soon enough in hers.  She had written him many letters of love.
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
Eh?
... Two-thirty-seven.
No.  He cut an ear from one of the men, no one else was hurt.  Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave. Athos was upset about the death of his son, at the front.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
The corridor nullifies our number... And no one has stomach to fight the Captain.
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
Cooperate?
You set to go -
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
I didn't hit shit!
When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work...
Gotta come from somewhere...
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
And who are you?
It wasn't in the cards.
Did he harm the girl?
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
What happened with the tape?
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
I knew I could count on you.
I'm not going anywhere!
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
Where is he?
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
That's when it happened?
What's the bottom line?
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
Twenty minutes max.
Book code?
Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me...
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
What else did you keep out of the papers?
Somebody hurt him?
As long as they're dead...
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
No other possibilities?
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
I'll pick you up in...
What?
How far away's the back-up?
Wait for the back-up! Will?
They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
It'll do fine.
Tonic will be fine.
You know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. At the Riker Institute for the Blind. I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
It's a surprise.
The Tooth...
Francis did a thing for you today so I couldn't have you. And he was wrong.  I AM THE DRAGON!  Give me your hand.
No!
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
I don't know...
Yes.
Oh, God.
Not me.
Yes.
God, no.
No.
Yeah. It's right here.
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Hi, Linda. ..
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
Thank you very much.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
What's average?
What did he want?
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
Blue, then.
Hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all I care...  Look, I'm sorry. When I come home, we'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
No.
I want to see you, too.
It's what Kevin called her when he was little...
Will?  You could come up here.
You going back down to Florida after?
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
My name's Will Graham. I...
I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom...
Yes.
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
Huh?
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
You read about it, I'm sure.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Yes.
Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
Big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
I want your opinion.
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
Okay... I'll go back.  But just let them know, first they ain't gettin' Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Yeah...
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
But it's funny!  It's a practical joke.  They'll get frustrated!
But it's only for thirty seconds!
Deal.
Okay, great!  So let's reset!
No thanks.
Hi... am I late?
If you want...
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
It's me.
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
Then your father's a wimp.
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
It is apparently not working.
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
Look... I don't know what your problem is...
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
I used to think you were original.
Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
Where?
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
It's already begun.
Hurry!
And you are?
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
Cypher?  Where's Tank?
An accident?!
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
Goddamnit!
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
No.
The Matrix?
What does that mean?
This can't be...
More important than what is when?
You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
Yeah.
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
What's going on?
Yes.  She's very old.  She's been with us since the beginning.
That's why we're here.
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
Yes, sir.
Do it!
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
How did you know...?
Honestly?  I don't know.
What?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
I just thought... you were a guy.
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
It's going into replication.
It disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
Are you worried?
It might have been.  I'm not sure.
There has to be something that we can do.
I have to.
I believe I can bring him back.
Do what?
Not yet.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
You're not far from Cypher.
I'll be all right.
I can't!
Thanks.
That means it's good.
Well the guy over there said...
All right!  Quiet!  For $40 I could give you...
Can't we come with you?
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
'And with your spirit.'
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
Kennedy.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
Not quite...but keep trying.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
No, she isn't.
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Did you see them run!
Oh, that's too bad, Teresa...
No you're not...
No.
What pipes?
I don't understand, where's Groppi?
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Yes, you did.
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
What was it?
Wha?
Well...
Charlie...?
What is it now?
Did you?
You missed the point.  The kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  He thinks he's in good standing.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
Sure...He lives there?
You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
The girls like it loud.
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
Yeah, so things'll be even.
I know...I know.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
You could say that.
Friends of yours Michael.
Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
Love that name.
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
No.
And you could care less --
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
Annie made them.
Yes, it is.
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
-- The late harvest Riesling, Mr. Quince, a possibility for dessert.
Both.
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
Right away.
Hi.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
Yeah.  Goodnight.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Hello, Quince.
Then why did you bring it up?
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
What'd it say?
'Yes' to the deal?
Sounds good.
As close as a deal could be.
What?!
What do you mean?
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
As much as Joe's?
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
Don't you want to hear the details?
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Certainly, Bill.
Joe, you do get around.
You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
I from dat nex' place.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
She knows you real self?
Sure.
As long as it takes.
Hey, this is fun.
Love.
You love Allison, don't you?
No.
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
Goodnight to you, Susan.
How nice you look.  Is that your uniform?
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Not now.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
I am.
Yes!
I love you in an evening gown.
Where are you going?
Then don't.
'Love will find out the way'.
It's a saying.
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
That's the best I can do.  ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Not at all.
Good night to you, Bill.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
That's what everybody says.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Oh.  Okay.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
I wouldn't put it that way.
I'm her father!
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
Not at all.
I was just asking, Bill.
Say again?
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
I don't expect you to.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I --
I think you know --
Quiet.
No thank you, Quince.  I'm sorry, honey.  I'm no good at this.  Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
Sure.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
Hi, honey.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
Nothing.
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Joe?
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
Yes, but --
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
You and 'Honey'?
I agree --
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
So you're a one-girl guy?
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
-- This is my lucky day.  I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
No --
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
I think I know her.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
I'm sorry... um... ?
I have no memory.
What's it like?
Couple days.
What?
Why?
Hi, Leonard.
I forget.
So you have information for me?
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Yeah. You?
Just relax.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
I told him about your car.
Calls himself Dodd.
Help me.
Can I ask you something?
Thank you.
What are you here for?
How do you know about me?
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
It's good.
You know it?
John Gammell?
I'll be waiting.							   *
Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
I'll ride with him. You follow.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
The Jaguar's out front. You didn't even Bother to put it around back.
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
Sammy let his wife kill herself! Sammy ended up in an institution - !				    *
Quit it!							 * 					   * You're not a killer, Lenny. That's why			 * you're so good at it.						   *
You can't just take it!
Why would I have a gun?
Fuck you; I gave you a reason to live and		   * you were more than happy to help. You lie		   * to yourself! You don't want the truth,			 * the truth is a fucking coward. So you			  * make up your own truth.						 *
Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
What's your twenty?
Grieve elsewhere.
They may have already, so we protect the living.  Proof she's alive?
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
Good.
Jos Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Tell them what you want.
Yes you do...
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
And what is that?
I'm a fiend for mojitas.
Later!  Do you dance?
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
That's right.
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
Twenty-eight-point-five.
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
I'll be on board by noon.
No.
I know.  And now?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Hey, Captain Kirk.  I think maybe I have second thoughts.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Mrs. Rico.  But don't worry.  She is safe.  To insure that, I am keeping her close to me.  It's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you.
Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
Alonzo...
What kind of weight?
Who knows...
Nothing.
On my way back...
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
Where's Riccardo?
Alonzo?  What are you talking about?  Where are you...?
I don't understand...
...look after her.  Ask Rico to. Okay?  Do that for me.  I had to do it.  They had me from the gate. Do that.  Whatever you can do for them.  Okay?  Look what I did to them, Sonny...!
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
He did volunteer one time...
Yes.  What's up?
The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow.
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Not French registry?
Jos doesn't like the deal in South Florida...
They're serious.  They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
Maritime.  Jose will fill you in.
Meaning...?
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
Nothing.  'Cause how you do delivery on the beach, I don't like.  Maybe this does not work.
I had to lay eyes on you.
No, ma'am, I'm not.
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
Whatsa matter now?
What's that supposed to mean?
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
Shee-it, man, I can't say all that.
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
You talk like a man with a tin twat.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
You like it? Take a look.
The coat? A guy I did a favor once gave it to me. Christ.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
Don't need a comb.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
Shee-it. You believe all you read?
Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
I'm wet.
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
Get outta my way.
Ready for anything.
Getchmis...?
Little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don't trust any of 'em...
Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
You want to split your hernia again?
How's your hernia?
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.
About ten kilometers.
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
...She was on the plane.
About as good as it looks.
Yeah.  That guy who beat me?  I feel stoned.
Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
A hundred grams.
That doesn't seem so bad.
How long?
Hello.
Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
What do you mean?
Two thirty.
Yeah.
Then I'll cut his balls off.
Oh shit.
Maybe he's changing jobs.
You can't take anything seriously.
What is it? . . . Billy?
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
20 minutes. If you don't go sight-seeing anymore.
You got a better way up?
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
Fuck you, wait a minute. I'm going to-
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
The kid's with them!!
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Please.
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
I'll be late.
Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
That's it?
Just like Trump Tower, then.
Oh, Jesus.
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
Anything you can tell me might help.
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
Well, I just thought--oh, look at me. You'd think I'd never had a house guest before. Would you like something to drink?
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
It has no nobility.
It's fine.
I can live with "great."
Well, I hope you like it.
Perfect.
Great.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
You do understand that this isn't the ordinary way books get written-- I mean, some people might actually consider this an oddball situation.
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
What? What happened to "I'll treasure whatever you do?"
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
--cliff-hangers--
They always cheated like that in cliff--  --chapter plays.
The what?
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
To Misery.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
It's good you found it.
G'bye, Ms. Sindell.
I'm sure you're right.
If I can.
No, the typing kind.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
Sean, please..
Well that depends.
Ahh..
Yeah.  Naturally vain -- but they're about to close the betting table and I haven't a sou..
And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
Not as much as you feel like hearing it.
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
In other words, you're calling her a flake.
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
We're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
And the check's in the mall.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
Uh-huh?
- torque wrench.
Do what?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
And six billion in the world.
Then feel better!..
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house, Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door.
Why did you phrase it like that?
- right.  In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
She sacrificed herself..
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
That simple, huh?
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
All storage and production of Chimera is done here, in this lab on the forty-second floor, the heart of the building.
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
What's happening here?  You're dead!
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
They'll kill me.
What about him...?
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
Hes putting on a show, Barnes.
I dont know.  It didnt say on the tickets.
Now we dont have to eliminate him?  You like that, dont you Claire?  Dont you?
Always.
Talking's good, walking's better.
Don't move.
No, I got out of the car and I ran to the bridge.
Take off your God damn coat!
You're sure about this?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
You don't think we're going to make it.
He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station...  And I'm going to call him.
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
My team.  Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah, maybe, I -- dont know
Location green.  One hour.  Ill be there myself.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Profitable.
You're all kidding yourselves. Even with top of the line crypto.  Cray access. STU 3's --
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Always.
Just don't chew it.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Why?
Very well.
When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
Can you lose him?
- and picked us up in the States -
I remember..
But, he didnt know about you.  In all fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "Thou shall not covet thy Neighbours wife", Ethan.  Oh, Ethan is in love with you, Claire, make no mistake about it.  And like all the worlds lovers, hes tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way I do?"
I think I might just take that look.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
Its not working.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
Why you drinking so much?
His brother.
And go to confession.
I won't come.
I didn't give you away the first time.
Maybe.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
What are you doing here?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
And what did they say?
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
You have too many dogs.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
I don't understand.
He knew my husband who died.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
You think so?
You really are stupid, you know that.
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
I'm telling you your life!
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
I'm in love with you!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
Awful?
You're late!
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
Loretta, what are you talking about?
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
No?
She was too young for him.
Yes?
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
We should talk alone.
If I marry you my mother will die.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Where you been?
No. Are you drunk?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
What sins have you to confess?
I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
I will. But I must find the right moment.
It's late.
I don't know.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Johnny...
Good.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Absolutely!
She was just too young for you.
I'm a housewife.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Sure.
Yes.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
Good night.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
Oh. Right.
Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
So how can we tell if she is made of wood?
Does wood sink in water?
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
Yes!
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
NI!   NI!
One that looks nice.
So be it!
'Tis but a scratch.
No, it isn't.
I've had worse.
Had enough?
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
You're a looney.
Come, Patsy.
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Oh yes.  It's very nice + +  CUT TO BATTLEMENTS. THE TAUNTER  turns to some others. + +                              MAN +      I told him we already got one. + +  They all giggle. +
My liege,  I am honored.
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
What does it say?
I am an enchanter.
Who did we lose?
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
Shut up!
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
Why do you think she is a witch?
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
To find the Holy Grail.
What is the capital of Assyria?
Here's one!
He hasn't got shit all over him.
Farewell, Concorde!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Oh, don't worry about that ... Tell me ... doesn't Camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains?
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Got it?
Yes?
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Camelot ...
I don't think I was.
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
No, no, we must find the Grail.
Ector.
We must examine you.
Please ... we are doctors.
Back to your bed!  At once!
I am, sir. I am a Knight of King Arthur.
That rabbit's got a vicious streak. It's a killer!
Look.  I'm warning you.
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
I've got my duties to attend to.
She'll be worried about me.
I hope to go up next year.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Of course.
A situation?
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
Out of my way!
It is quite late enough.
And that is my last word on the matter.
Back and upper corridors.
Is that the Queen's request?
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
I'm fine.
It's nothing.
I wouldn't know.
Why?
I do what I do.
See what?
They aren't as watchful as you.
No love.
In time, she will.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Archie.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
What?
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Are they worth reading?
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
I heard something.
Then why send me back to them?!
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Yes.
No, indeed.
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
I understand he was in a fight.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Yes, ma'am.
He is sick, ma'am.
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
Yeah, who isn't.
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
It's the game, ARCADE.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Did you play ARCADE last night?
I came from the city on the left.
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
But he was playing the game.  I mean, you saw him...
Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
Funny.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
Sure.
She thought Benz was at school.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
It's already out.
I don't know.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
One.  In case...
You've got the schematics, check.
Right, then...
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
And then keep on driving?
Hold my keys, then.
In this world, wrong is right!
I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
Yes...but...how did you...
That's impossible.
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
What's going on, Cynthia?
I'm going home.
I know.  Where are you Adam?
And getting stranger. Where do I meet this Cowboy? I mean do I have to ride out to the range?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
How's that?
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
Are you okay?
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
But you won't.
Before what?
Diane?
"Then they'd put you in jail."
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
I just wanted to come here.
This Denny's.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Interesting.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Great ! You couldn't be a fan of Dolphins or some other less threatening animal.
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
We have to climb up that.
It's a tax write off for John C. McCay.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
Excuse me ?
Is this really the time ?
What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
Let's go.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Yes.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Not quite....
I did, but this room has four exits and only one opens, it's up to them in the control room. There's one right over there. The exit light is on, but he can change it.
Are you hunting wabbits ?
You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Look...
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
What ? Are you my mother ?
When will that be ?
RESPECT is earned not given away, trust is given away to anybody.
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
I am thirty two.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
John, sir.
What did you hear ?
I was.
I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
What ?????
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
I'll see that bet.
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
Yes.
Thanks.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
Which one, this door is locked !
What ?
We made it !
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Oh, just put it over there.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Your Uncle Phil told me.
I would do it again in a minute.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
You're still asking me to break the law.
Pommeroy.
Hello, I'm gonna need this right now...this guy...well we think he might be going after the governor.  Twenty minutes? Fine.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
Great.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Totally groovy huh?
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
You're being narrow-minded.
I remember Maggie...and your Dad too, you know we used to all pile into his old 54 Ford pickup. &quot;Chuck the Truck&quot; we used to call it.
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
You mean, you knew about me?
You are?
I'll try.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
Well...
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
But I wanna write about her.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
I want juice!
I won't.
You're over reacting!
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
May I use the phone please.
He is one of the great poets.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
DON'T, come on!!!
DON'T!!!
This is a totally barbaric custom.
He's an undertaker.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.

I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
There's plenty of fruit.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
You know how I feel about you.
Not exactly.
Bye Niece, Vada.
I was commenting on your hair.
Yes, I do.
Oh, sure okay.
Is there milk in them already?
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Well you've gotta be prepared.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
Good for you baby.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
WHAT?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
What happened to her?
Goodnight.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Then who's it for?
Why?
No, sweetie, not yet.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
I know, I know, let's go on the &quot;sit on the bench and rest&quot; ride.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Get away, get away!!
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Will you tell her I came by?
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
For this class?
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
He likes her.
Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but he made me laugh.
I am.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Thomas?
Yes!!
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Well he just left, what's wrong?
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
Uh huh.
They're just fun to read.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
It's my mother.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
He likes her better than me.
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
Not true.
Like they do on TV?
But, I don't know how.
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
He's still in love with you.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
Desperate.  To talk.
You like her.
Go figure you.
Impressive.
Try less appropriate.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
I can't even say it.
Major.  Dish.
Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
I've missed a step.
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
Exactly.
He won't get mad, huh?
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
... that this is all my fault?
... unless he has a hump.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
It doesn't say th...
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
W...
Hate that.
What, leaving school...
That would be a girl.  I don't even know.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Boy, those were the days.
Never can tell.
Like I said, dazzling.
Have you.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
It means a lot.
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
She admits it's her fault.
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
This is where I proposed.
That's little egotistical.
What is that sup...
MICHAEL!!
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Don't feel that way, honey.
How is that?
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Who the hell is he?
Who the hell is he?
What does he want?
I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
D.C.
To the bathroom.
Yes, sir. Like you to meet Opal.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
Your brother?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
Suits me.
Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
Well, he's really amazing.
I don't really know what you're talking about.
No.
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Bye.
It just is.
Tom. You remember?
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
Well...
That's unkind.
Oh.
What...?  0h, yes.
Don't you worry about Sueleen Gay.
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
Hello.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Might be good for you.
Out.
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Did it break?
Why?
No, we never did that
He ain't really new.
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
I'll be dammed.
You think I should take lessons?
Yes, I would.
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
We had nothing to do with that riot. That riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Thanks. Roll 'em, Donut.
Don't stop!
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
I can appreciate that.
By all means.
Ain't love grand.
I've never wounded anything in my life. I got you locked right between the eyes.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
It's video.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
She sings? What does she sing?
I'm keen with anticipation.
I'm sure we will.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
On average forty million.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
So, what now?
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
I do, too.
They actually apologized.
It's hard to say Capt'n.
Wayne---
Thanks.
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
How 'bout Mallory?
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
When do you want the assembly?
Slate it.
How so?
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
What are we talking about?
I can't do that. Five guys.
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
Thanks, Duff. You' a nice guy. Not like Frankie.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
Well, what d'you know?!
No. You got the wrong idea.
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Like hell they wouldn't.
Yeah. On the section gang.
How d'you mean?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
Oh yeah, and then what?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Why did you?
That's the way he is.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
Four.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
How about it?
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
Yeah?
Come here, baby.
We can always do that, Duff.
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Watch out!
There's nothing to say.
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
'Round town.
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
What's on your mind?
Okay.
She'll do.
Sorry.
I said, she's in great shape.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Guess it's never been easy.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
I guess I ain't.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
Oh yeah?
How you doin'?  Hi there!
That'll make the folks very happy.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Right here.
You hate Raoul?
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
You've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. I'd like to hear what it is.
What does this have to do with me?
You son of a bitch...
Dixie McCoy
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
I don't have a girl.
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Can you walk?
No problem, amigo.
Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
Can you take me to it?
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
Wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. Reprogrammed him.
How long, Dixie?
It's coming.
Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
I thought you already left.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
And Linda...
Why should I want to meet him.
What's my end?
Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
What's that supposed to mean?
So you're a wire junkie.
A regular Fagan.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
I don't sleep much. You packed?
Not when Sense/Net throws the going away party. They'll be on our asses from now on.
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Sure... Maelcom's a rude boy, right, Maelcom?
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Well, do you?
Nice.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
Yeah, I know.
Exactly.
Right. 7:30.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
Leave.
If you say so.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"?
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Anita, remember espadrilles?
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
That is lingerie.
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Uh uh. I'm Disco Barbie.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Are you in special ed?
Yeah, you gonna be there?
Hey. There.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
I'm Rob's prom date.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
See!
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
I know.
wasn't even thinking about-
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
College. Haven't really thought about it.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
When are you going to open your eyes?
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
Yeah, I have.
I finally found my story.
I know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
Barrel.
We can handle it.
And heavy...
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
I know.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Specifically.
<i>                      Now and forever...</i>
<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
<i>                      Shut up and listen...!</i>
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Oh, come on Dad...
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
He's dead, you bitch.
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
Only the wet ones.
I'm sorry...
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Yeah, yeah, sure.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
Wow...
World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
Only it was more like, you know, sleep- walking.  All I know is I woke up on the cellar floor next to it.
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
I don't know.  Where are we going?
C'mon, cut it out.
Uh-uh.  Wait...
I'll get over it.
Maybe we can do that.  Strictly scientific, of course.
What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's inside me...
No, Jesse.  This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
'Morning, honey.
No.  I'm okay.
Hi, Kerry.
They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
Don't hold your breath.
Watching TV.
Wait and see.
YOU'RE HOT STIT WITH A LITTLE MUTE KID -- LET'S SEE YOU TAKE A PIECE OF ME!  KRUEGER!
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
Sure.
Yeah, but I was really not good.
How do we find him, Kristen?
So?
What?
Those are ancient history.
A little basic, but nice.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
This isn't possible.  And even if it is...what the hell am I doing here?  Did you drag me in here too?
Don't you think I know that?  I don't have any choice.
There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
What about Kristen?
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Cooling down.
Don't worry, it won't come to that.
Night, night, Honey.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Well, they can be.
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
No thanks.
I forgot my bag.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
And what happens next in the dream?
Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
She saw through me.
You've got to go.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
How do you think I'm doing?
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
You do?
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Thank you.  Shall I...
What's the thing?
And what would you say...
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
He wouldn't say.
Anna Scott?
The movie star?
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
Yes -- sort of...
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
The others?
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
That's not fair.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
What are the choices?
Point taken.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Yes.
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Would you like to start?
I was in luh-love with her.
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
What for?
Right!
Go on...
Jesus Christ, the man doesn't want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
Thank you, ma'am.
H-H-Hearts.
B-B-Billy.
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
Some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, Randle, and will b b-be here long after this Wo-Wo World Series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what's the use anyway...
'K-k-kay, Mack!
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
W-W-Where we g-g-going?
Just fine, Billy boy, just fine. Full of piss an' vinegar! They checked my plugs and cleaned my points...
Ca-na-da...
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Right, Mack!
Hey, what's that?
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
Me, too...
Me too...
Your buddy is callin' ya.
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
Okay, Harding, you're on.
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
Just warmin' up.
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
What for?
I refuse!
I don't trust you!
No!
Can you borrow me a dime?
No. Me! Me!
Yeah, it's cold!
Oh, what was that?
I see.
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Good. Good.
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Look, miss, I don't like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
'Kay, Mac!
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
What's going on?
Shhh!  This way!
Come an' see.
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
I don't have any.
Huh?
Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
Now you talkin'.
Bet you ass...
Take you han's offa me!
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
Yes, ma'am...
Shhh... let's move it away from the window...
Shhh, please, Miss. Keep it down...
I thought so.
You ol' fucker!
Why?
--separate, in the evening..."
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Except possibly that.
Dwayne?
What's mezzaluna?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Wait.  I have to write this down.
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
But, Faith--
Hi there...
Thanks.
I take it things didn't work out between the two of you?
Right.  Thanks a lot.  And congratulations.  It's not easy finding love these days.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
NO.
Yes.
Who says I don't love him?...
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Mickey Spillane?
Well, good.  Good for you.
What are you doing here?
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
No.  I just came by to apologize.
I know the feeling.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
I can't believe you did that!
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
I would call it-- unforgivable.
Just since yesterday.
You would?  Really?
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
So?...
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
I know.  You're right.
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
You don't have a passport.
Maybe.
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
He fell out.
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
Because I'm the one who's single.
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
Like a detective.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
A little bad luck?
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Is Damon Bradley here?
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
You miss me?...
No, why?
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
Went to high school with him. But...
She's not here.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
You know Johnny when he gets mad.
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
Gimme.
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
He probably gave 'em an argument.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Maybe.
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
I wish I knew, Edie, But 
You training to be a nun or something?
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
How would you've done it?
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
I am?
Hit me again, Mac.
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
What a fruitcake you are!
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
What for?
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
Who says?
I just told the Father.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
He's going to have to grow up too.
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Someone else c'n take your confession.
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
You go to
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it  Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little   cap pistol.
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
Are you on the level, Father?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Down to the wire?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Take it easy.
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him boy, I was ready that night.
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under   whop-whop!
Sure... .
You'd be off the pier for good.
Doyle.  Joey Doyle's... .?  ... .You're his... .
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
Take it easy now, Terry.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this  to remember them by.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
Now just a minute, I
Listen, Johnny
What do you mean?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Well, fact or not, I don't see how we're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight.  I can't see a thing!  Let's turn back.
It frightens me.
What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
What can we do against them?
A symbol, Master.
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
At the first sight of the morning sun's rays, we must be gone.
It would seem so, Master
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
Then cancel my order.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Yes, Master.
Then why do you shake so?
Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.
Aannnnaahhnn.
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
And the one driving the other car?
Who is it?
What?!
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Really.  Hm.
Yes.
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
Uh-huh...
He isn't fighting no more.  Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Time comes, we knock on the door.  See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Yes, she did.
You know how I felt about her.
I don't know.
Whatta you wanna do?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
You'll have to ask him.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
You're gonna use a ram?
Wait.  You not Adele?
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Wait, I know him --okay?
There a problem, Foley?
Just like it.  Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy.  Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
I wasn't asking permission.
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
You'd probably tell me.
Really.
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
What, as a sales rep?
It smelled.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
She did, huh.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
Yeah?  She said that to you?
I don't know...
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
How many?
Okay.  How many going out?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours.  Why?
What's to think about?
Siddown, Dick.  They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
Five point two.
Islamic.
Hejira.
Like what?
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills.  Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
That's Kenneth, my brother.  He's talking on the phone.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
He's still married though, huh?
I see that.
Hello?
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
That's right, just me.
No.  Course not.
So the woman's married.  She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it.  But you don't reveal her name, you protect her.  It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.  Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
He was that good?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
Hale-what?
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
You guys get those!  Earl, Rafe, come with me!
Kill the bastards!
Home of the brave!
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
We got a saying here.  A-low-HA!
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
Bombers.
Our doctor's gone too.
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Dorie Miller, 'Mam.
You too, Lieutenant.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
Do one thing for me, before you go.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
I need to tell you something.  I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand.  Forgive me.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
And if we fail, and lose our carriers, we destroy our ability to fight them at all.  As soon as the second wave returns, we will withdraw.
Have the planes made it to China?
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
Learn English, then!
Crank her!
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
Peggy Sue!
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Peggy Sue!
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
I can't. It's all too much.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
Just what you underlined.
That loudmouthed little bitch~
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
Yeah. I've gotta go. Arthur's picking me up soon.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
Pretty strange.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
Refresh my memory.
Maybe I blocked it out.
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
What am I going to do with you?
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
I just can't trust you anymore.
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
That's real big of you.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
You're going to listen to me.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
Charlie? Was I dead?
What about Janet?
I'll just set it right here.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Touchy, touchy!
Take a long walk on a short pier.
I wish I had the nerve. And the figure.
It must run in the family.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
For everyone.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
Open it.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
This is your great invention?  Would you wear those things?
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
For what?
Way to go, Mom!
Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
What's inside?
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
Did you break up with Charlie?
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
I had a little run-in with Zowie.
You alright?
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
I'm not hungry.
Just until he heals up?
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
Zowie.
There's a better place...
What did?
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
He was dead. You know he was.
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
All the time.
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
Andy, do you know who reps Kronos Inc.?
Sorry...
Andy?
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
One hour!
I have too much work to do. Skip the treatment.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
Honesty is always best.
About my blood work?
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
As in, the vegetable?
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
We're friends of Beckett's.
I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great.
Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
I suppose you could say that.
Yes. On my torso.
What?
Absolutely.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Yes.
Thank you. No more questions.
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Right.
But he's got lots of other people's lives to ruin...
Aren't you?
Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
My lettuce is wilting.
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
By God you <u>will</u> settle it! If you force this case to trial, young man, you'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days... Now, Joseph. What would you require to settle this matter today?
Andy, you don't want this.
Charles...
Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God.
Lookit. Lookit!
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Show me your eyes.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Entered our minds.
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
Had it with deals.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Saw something I didn't like.
<u>Listen</u>.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
I can't....I can't....
I know what's in here!
Big Evil?
Only around humans.
Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
How many?
60 years ago.
We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
-- we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
Anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, Johns? Christ, here I am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
79 kilos.
Riddick. <u>Riddick</u>.
Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. To know God, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
I would rather we all stay--
And what about the cells?
Has anyone checked the coring room?
Which half?
He will be with us. Nonetheless.
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. And if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
I'll need a receipt for that.  For all these.
Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India. Very rare.
About the girl.
They been nose-open for her ever since we left. They go off blood.
Just realized that, huh?
Nice embellishment.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
So much for my cocktail hour.
Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
Doesn't need to be. Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You'll get picked up.  Right?
Yes, sir, so it was -- thanks to you. But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written ...
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the planet.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
What signal?
You don't seem very cut up about it.
long pause) You know it.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
But I'm not prepared to die.
Let's take a look.
Try telling them our names.
Zira doesn't want your female.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
I think you're making a mistake.
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours.
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Yes.
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
Taylor, please --
We can't.
Of course. He saw you moving yours.
Yes, Sir.
This is his assertion.
Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his identity.
Where?
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
How the hell did he get away?
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Yeah, what is it?
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.
I volunteered.
What are the heads?
...there's nobody.
Y'ever get caught in a mistake King and you just can't get out of it?
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
He dugged his own grave.
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
Thank you.
I'm trying very hard to be polite about it.
How do you do?
Why certainly, baby.
Just drunk enough.
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
Possibly, Miss.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
He got in here how?
There wasn't any plane.
No thanks.
Bad enough.
Quarter after one. Why?
Just who are you, anyway?
All right--following me.
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
I'm in the Hudson Bay Company's store.  That man last night--the one that followed me--
No percentage in that.
They'll look for you.
This must have cost a fortune.
Frozen.
Wonder what?
I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
The money that makes you Mr. Clark Brandon.  Let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the Vancouver Royal.  Lets you own a cruiser. Lets you do as you please, go where you please.  You big, open-handed, generous guy.  That's the kind of money it takes, isn't it?
You-killed-him?
I'm still on course to Victoria. Nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Magruder does.
Do you think I was faking?
I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
Who hasn't--one way or another?
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
What does he see?
Jeff.  Shall we go now, Jeff, and get it over with?
They'll only find someone else-- who won't be so kind.
Because you think your in love with me?
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
I know that.
You asked for it.
Got the information on you?
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Sometimes.
Leave that one lay.
Round of golf Saturday?
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Would that make me a heel?
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
How would you know, Brandon?
Mr. Mitchell.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
Sardonic, if you will my dear. Bust nasty. You lied about the gun.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Would you?
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
You get it's brother.
They tell me he'll be a great loss to the liquor trade. This Mayfield girl...
I'll know when I find it.
Somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Such as?
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Positive?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
How did you know?  Clarendon.  You cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
Not if it clears the air.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Yes, sir.
I think you'd be entirely justified, sir.
I do.
Two.
Not too far, I hope.
Why should I mind?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
You already have the checks, darling.
It's kind of you to see me.
Yes.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost.  Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian.  In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
What went wrong?
Very good.
Exactly that.
Hello.
No.  I'd want to--
I'd want to set out events as they happened.  The way I see it is this: the British Empire was an ideal.  It may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century, but it wasn't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect, which is what I think the Conservatives were trying to do.  Then there's the essential--
Yes, please.
And I didn't like that man.
And you're at this third stage
Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
No.  It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
To the airlift.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
To the Fleet.
Jeremy, just let me see what you've got.
Let me see.
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
You're a piece of shit
Hello.
I'm not here.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Voila!
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
No.
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Not yet.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
You gotta earn trust.
You first!
Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
I'm not FBI anymore.
There's nobody else here...
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Not so far.
Babes.
The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
The fucking punks are surfers.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Thanks, buddy.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Right here, partner.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Did he rob it?
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Kid, get outta the way!!
I need you to teach me.
Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
Something... in the trees...
They're getting better equipped every day.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
We're not going.
We found 'em both, dead. And the gear from the chopper. If they're Central American, I'm a fuckin' Chinaman. By the looks of 'em, I'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA.  Another thing, Major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are Russians, military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen here.
There's something else, Major...
Hawkins?
I think it's Hawkins.
You'll want a cocktail dress then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful figure.  A little too out in the open but simply lovely.  Size six? Do you need shoes?
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Please, we hardly know each other.
No.
What?
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid.  But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
Sure.  For five bucks.
You're not from L.A., huh?
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
I never joke about money.
What?
Can I have some chips?
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Oooh, thank god.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Just a romantic, that's you.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
No shit.  They expensive?
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
Dinner can wait.
No.
He's good at what he does.
Ready to stomp sod?
Vivian, what the --
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
My what?
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
Oh, god, what?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
We just did.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
Yes.
I bet.  That was our rent!
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Dummy.
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
Okay.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
I'm just looking, thanks.
I think it's great.
Don't worry.  I'll pay for it. What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, <u>maybe</u>?  Are you a fifty dollar whore?
Then why bother curing me?
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
I do not marry tonight.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
As you wish.
Of course you will.
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
Well ... you were dead.
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
Anybody want a peanut?
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
If there are, we'll all be dead.
-- what? --
I have a little.
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Over the Albino, I think.
Where did you get that?
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
My spy network has heard no such news.
It won't be easy, Sire.
No.  To the pain.
Of course.
Yes.
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
Let me explain --  -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it?  Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
Not yet.
Light him.
-- power too -- promise me that --
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
Again. Thank you.
Oh, have it your way.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Hmm.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Nobody's hearing nothing!
Congratulations.
What are you saying?
I'll wait in the hall ...
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
I have hurt your feelings.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Aaaaaaaaaa!
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
Coney Island??
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it!
You found a flop!
Only if we ask him.
What???
What is it?
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
You crazy lunatic!  What are you shooting at us for?  Why don't you use this  where it will do us some good?  Why don't you shoot the actors?  Liebkind, have I ever steered you wrong?
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Call chauffeur.  Get car.
We can't play today?
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia.
By the sacred memory...
Wagner...
Bismark...
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
I mean in show business.
Send for Goebbels.
I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
How early?
How did she pay you?
And when she left, she never came back.
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
Someone is sitting in that window.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
Of course not. Please.
All right.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
And the police haven't been able to...
What difference does that...
May I talk to you?
I want to know if my sister is here.
Don't you know?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
An hour! Or less!
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
This is Lila Crane, from Phoenix. She's been here for a few days, looking for her sister. There's a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he'd traced Mary...
You're not.
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I have?
No.
I'd like to.
I mean... ill.  She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... I was only five... and it must have been a strain. Oh, she didn't have to go out to work or anything, Dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... Mother met a man. He talked her into building this motel... We could have talked her into anything... and when.  Well... It was just too much for her when he died, too... And the way he died... Oh, it's nothing to talk about when you're eating.  Anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
To a private island, like you?
Norman.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Please... I'd like to go...
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
Have you two had breakfast?
I suppose you want a cabin.
Uh, uh! My boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. I better sign in and get a receipt.
Haven't any.
Leave me alone!
From what?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Indeed, he has often told me.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
You--a friend to me?
Hm--pressure-- To Buckley. That's all right. We'll talk later.
Maybe you're right.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
How? What can I do?
A voice ...
Yes, the child ...
Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
No? Give me a chance, baby. Money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
I'm not quarreling, only ...
Oh, you children, you happy children. You've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. And that is as it should be. Never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
It happens that I'm the law.
Been doing experiments with Scotch and soda again?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
Sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
Get out of here.
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
Well, maybe it was. I don't remember.  You got to do something for me, I can't stand it any longer -- I can't!
How's every little thing?
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Hotcha! Saved, one job!
Horsefeathers!
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
You taking any medication?
Dad...
I could go out of town.
Where to?
It's an experiment.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
What is it, Rose?
But, Rose, what is the cause of it all?
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Well, some fiend might.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Yeah.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Five hundred rabbits?
What was your mother like?
Oh, Waski, you don't know anything.
Well, a little.
But how would you find him?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
No.
She's watching the car again?
Is that all?
Let me look.  Aww-rr...
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Sense doesn't mean anything to Rose. But I think we're on safe ground now. Daddy chained up the ladder, whoever it is can't get in the house.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life.
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
No, son, she is dead.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Oh, it's definitely better, beyond question. A fatherless child, an ignorant girl with no job, no money, no home. It's fortunate, a blessing really, and a stroke of good luck for another reason I want to mention to you.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
I think we both know her.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
What?
Oh. Did you say something?
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
Honey, please...
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that!
What did you forget?
Fine.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
I... I'll get the grits.
Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
No, sir.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
Yes, sir.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Tennessee?
Galley proof.
She has other things to do, Dave.
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Be quiet, Rose.
Incestuous.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
What and?  That's what I got.
Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
What... ?
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
I'd rather you guys didn't do this again.
Hands off the suit, monkey-boy. Close your eyes if you're scared.
Stop blaming yourself.
Yeah.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
Name one.
They shot us all, kid.
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
Forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
Follow me.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
You're lying...
No.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
We've got the tape to prove it.
There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
Slow down.
Don't crowd him.
No you're not.
You think this is so easy?
Oh yeah?
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
Billy!  Billy!
They're... around.
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.  Told you they'd do it!
Yoda will always be with you.
Yoda spoke of another.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
That's all any of us can see.
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Your father he is.
Yes.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
Rocky!
Janet.
Janet.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Dammit, Janet.
Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
Weiss.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
Goodbye
Now I
Like I'm outside in the rain
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
I think it's closed.
It doesn't bother me either.
It's fine.
No, I don't belong here.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
I'll be waiting.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
...Yes --
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Don't say that.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Why?
That so.
Paulie!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
You're hurtin', man!
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Fouls.
Very high an' very fast.
No wine.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
How 'bout some Cokes?
Charge it.
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
You have my food in ya hand.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
...Fine.
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Yeah.
...Thanks.
Rocky.
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
Stuff it, man!
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
Yeah.
I got pain an' experience too.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Would you keep goin'?
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
'Bout what?
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
I'm thirty myself.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Maybe ya better forget it.
He's takin' cheap shots.
Sure I like her.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
What can I do about it?
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
You serve martinis, doncha?
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
I oughta have my head examined.  Will you hold still?
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
Sounds like singin'.
Yeah?  Well, don't expect the Toons to give you a gold watch.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Surprised?
Toon cops worked me over.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
What a gasser.
No one knows.  He bought the election a few years back.  He's been rulin' Toontown ever since.
So what do you want me to do?
I don't work in Toontown.
So's the job.
Have you got the will?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No, I don't.
Take it easy.
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
A Toon?  Noooo.
No, it's not.
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
Forget it.
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
[Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
Uh? Uh?
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
Romeo will answer it?
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
In love?
Of love?
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Art thou hurt?
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
O, mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities: for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give, nor aught so good, but strain'd from that fair use revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse: virtue itself turns vice, being misaplied; and vice sometimes by action dignified. Within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power: for this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part; being tasted, slays all senses with the heart. Two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs, grace and rude will; and where the worser is predominant, full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
What wouldst thou have with me?
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
Is that right?
Leaving...
The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
I thought I did.
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
You were a soldier, were you?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
You don't have to explain yourself to me, Deirdre.
I don't know...  Well I don't!  It's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you.  But I do know who we're working for.  My people, and the Russian mob.
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
Ready when you are...
There's a problem...
You first, Edvard.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
I sent it to myself in Paris.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
Really?
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
Not exactly.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
I didn't expect that he would.
Perhaps.  But you are not healthy, and if you try I'll kill you.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Who's they?
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
You should learn a little patience.
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
No thanks.
I don't.  But the language he's speaking is universal.
One's a lot more painful than the other.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
Please, help yourself.  Smoke as many you'd like.
A lot of people died.
I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
You know one around here?  Somebody you trust?
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
You see the bullet?
If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
I would have tried not to.  But yes, if it would have kept him from shooting you, I would have.
Right now?
So I do it.
Just like that?
Finish the job...
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Gone.  Destroyed.
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
How is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us?
You should have kill him when you had the chance.  But no...
I might know where you could get a copy.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
I want to get some hounds down here.
I can't get enough of it.
Never heard of it.
Maybe.  Who cares?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
We assaulted a Federal agent.  We killed him.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
Forget the copies!  He could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
No.
If you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
I don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  Besides, I'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
I don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. Booth looks at Earl --
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
I'm just making our intentions clear. Go check the desk.
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
Uh huh.
Why don't you get to the point.
What's your offer, Jesse?
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
You mean that guy was an agent?
What for?
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
I love you too.
How the hell did he find it?
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
I don't know.  My friends...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
I don't believe it.
Yeah.
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
Did you say After Midnight?
Lingerie...
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
I mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Yeah.  That's all I need, to become one of your in-laws.
So be here at three.
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
So I want the money and I want it now.
You're never getting that much.
Hi.
Nope. If you're a criminal you don't carry ID, and if you do you're a damn fool.
Absolutely positively.
So someone did get away.
We're going to find out.
Sir, I'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time I get back they're gonna make you Governor.  Captain, you there?  Hello?  Shit!
What??  Where'd you hear that?
Little Chang is gonna have to go visit his daddy in jail if you don't cooperate.
I'd like to see you try.
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
So what's your story?
You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
I'm sorry.
How you doin'?
I'm calling for back up!
Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
Who?
Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
How do you know?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
What did you say?
What's going on?
She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
What?
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
Mind your own business.
No mu-shu.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Oh no you don't.  Don't you be getting corny on me, Lee.  I'll kick your ass from here to Compton.
Follow me my Asian brother.
Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us.
Wait here.  I'll handle this.
Carter...
No problem.
It's okay.  I can finally let it go.
The Plaza Hotel?
Some Kung-Pao?
What "revenge" is he talking about?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Just trying to make it look real.
Why don't you go get them?
Did you tell Sterling?
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
I know, but --
Tell me about it.
You're shittin' me.  You know the Beach Boys?!
No.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Stool pigeon.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
No, no.  I'm full. Too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  scuse me.
You drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
You think this is funny, Carter?  You send for someone from Explosives!? Four men just died in there!
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
I wouldn't touch that if I were you.
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
She's fine.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
It's Griffin.
Pack it into black garbage bags. Throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the Fang Shan Restaurant in China Town.  You have twenty-nine minutes left.
Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
Ike just came by to check out the team.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy.
What did he ask?
And what did you say?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
He's here!... He's here!
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
What?
That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it.
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
No.  No, you didn't.
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
"Paid vindication"  That's what I call justice.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Looking for Maggie.
No, she's talking about your hair.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Originality is my speciality.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
We think so.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Seven-fifty.
You afraid to try?
You don't know.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Missed me bad, huh?
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right?
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Me?
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
Yup!
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
Lighten up, what?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  Holy moly.
No.
Houseboats don't go anywhere.
-- who's married to --
I love you.
Does it have wheat in it?
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
No.
You couldn't.
-- it was a betrayal.
I think that's what I'm saying.
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
What was what?
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
Turn on your radio!
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
Okay.
Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
A sense of humor.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Yes, I did.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
What?
Magic.
Mom!
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
What's she talking about?
I don't think I could really describe it.
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show.  But what the hell.  It's not one specific thing.  It's more of a feeling. 
Why not?
What's tira misu?
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
Window.
Oh, you're changing your mind --
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
They called and asked for it.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
English muffin.  How do you do it?
I look stupid.  I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard.  I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut. 
The heels on these shoes are very large.  Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
There she is.
Okay.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
No.
It's a short word.
If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
This is the one I like.
Thank you, Jonah.  But the point is, I am not asking permission.
Get out.
If I didn't go.
Sure.
Hi.  Sam?
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
I know her pretty well.  Maybe I could call her --
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
So much the better.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
With Ramn it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
Got to talk to the brothers.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What's more important than sanitation?
Never... never... never!
I'm a fool.
Antonio paid for it.
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
What makes you so sure?
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
Can be what?
Yes.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
No.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Will you be still?
Look who's talking! The Great White Father, and World's Champion of Women's Rights.
You mean Delaware?
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
T! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
No.
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
You like that?
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Leave me out of this.
This man sounds like a real catch.
How?
Trust me. We're safe.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
You always been this stubborn?
I just can't. Okay?
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
It's Tom.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
I'm serious, dude.  You always seem to be on top of things, even when you're tweakin'.
Can your man handle that?
10%.  That's ...
He doesn't have one.
Sure, Jimmy.
Yes, Jimmy.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
No, I'm good.
Make me an offer.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, okay.
Big Bill.
Big Bill
What?!
Yeah.
I'll keep that in mind.
It was all pretty informal.  Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
When?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
Whata you mean?  He told me -
Answer the fucking question!
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
That would be me.
You mean the menacing red car?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Now that's scary!
I thought you were done.
It was a hard assignment, that's why you got it.
You writin' a book or somethin'?
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Shut up, will you?
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Nope, he ain't Wade.
Like hell, you did.
You didn't volunteer, Jackson.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
White-walls?
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
Senator's son?
It was nothing.
I don't expect to live that long.
Did he see any sign of them?
A machine gun.
Same place we are.
Those guns are close.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
I want Reiben on B.A.R; Jackson with his sniper rifle; Beasley, demolition.
Tell that to Private James Ryan. We've got our orders.  Let's go.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
You're kidding yourself.
How about you shut up and take your position?
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Snatches the morphine from Sarge. Quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot.  He's done this before.
Let's just find someplace.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Stay at it until you get fire control.  Keep 'em down, wait for the navy.
Stands on the edge of the woods, almost in a trance.
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
We can't leave it here.
See to it.
I coach the baseball team, too.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
We have records.  We have proof.  I'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but it's going to get worse.  Now, if I were you, I would take that fellowship.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
He's a mess!
What's a scam?
Lloyd, give it up.
Hang in there, man.
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Alright.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
Okay.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
I know that.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
You're going.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Swear to god.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Hi.  You called me?
Yeah?
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
Well, not monumentally.
Hmmm....
Pardon me?
Eight.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Basic.  Hmmm.
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
Yeah?
You think so?
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Okay, bye, I will.
I'll see you there.  Bye.
Okay.
I'm doing alright.
You're cold.
Then why are you shaking?
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
We decided...
No, no.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
I know.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength.  Poor little man.
No.
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Fine Lloyd.
How do you pay for one of those?
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Are you?
Very talented.
I know this part, keep reading.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
I called her up.
Alright.  Key?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
I got a question.  If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
Oskar, please -
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
True.
What's going on?
I don't know.  Soon.
These people, my people, I want my people.
I just told you.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
Yeah, I can.
That's great.
She's good.
Things are great, things are great.
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
Simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  Change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
They should be.
Yes.
The war could end.
Do what?
Christmas presents.
What other point is -
They're withholding payment.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking I'd pull Jesse off...
That doesn't work, sir.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
They've broken their pattern.
On national television.
It's hell week. Chill. The movie murders have brought out the crazies. It's nothing.
What is it?
I'm losing you.
That's too bad.
Why would you wanna do that?
I had to change. Did anyone call?
She dumped me.
Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
I'll get my jacket.
No. This is a set up.
But nobody wants to see that. Itll never go. Theyll rewrite you. You dont want that.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
What guy?
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
I really dont like that comparison, honey.
I find his work overwrought.
Until now.
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Just for you, Sid.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
No, I'm the one who's sorry. I misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some oozing to do.
Meaning?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
..and as lonely as I am...
And Joel's pre-med.
He filmed his victims.
They don't know. It was carefully planned. Earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
What if your life depended on it?
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
Oh my God.
I have to watch rehearsal.
Hello?  Hello?
Nah...I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Maureen looks at Phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD SCREAM That is matched by the entire audience as they SCREAM at the screen.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
Easy black boy.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
Listen to me. We've got to get help. The Killer's here.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Wait, wait. Don't hang up.
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
More of a game really.
Very good. Now we play ROUND 2.
Horror flicks. B-Movies from Milton's heyday.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
Ben Damon. Christine Perkins. Sarah Darling. Tom Prinze. That's four, last time I learned how to count.
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
To me Hollywood is about death.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
That is for me to decide.  I need to talk to her Mr. Riley, she is a key element in this case.  I have a press conference in an hour, and I need to explain why there are four dead celebrities.
Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
No.
Jesus Christ Dewey help me! They tried to kill me in the bathroom! The killers!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
And?
Someone stole Sid's file?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Oh.  Yeah, I guess I do.
Just Jennifer.  And you.
Do you want us to come with you?
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
I don't know. Screw them. Look, what's important is that we stick together. No matter what. If anyone is next it's you or me Jen.
What the hell are you doing?
I am Gale Weathers!
There a story in that building?
Good twist.
GALE WEATHERS?! What are you doing here? No press on the set!  No press, no press on set! Get that woman out of here.
Who?
Heh, well, that's TV journalism for ya. Stage the news to boost ratings.
You mean what's left of us.  Yeah I'm running on empty anyways. Gotta refuel.
Let's get out of here!
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
What character?  I'm Candy, the chick who gets killed second.  I'm only in two scenes!
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
Who is this?
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Oh yeah.
And did they really ever explain why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people? Don't think so. You see, it's scarier when there's no motive, Sid.
Get the gun. I'll untie Pops.
She looked dead. Still does.
I just wanted to see her, that's all.
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
Now that it's out of your system.
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
It's okay. We need to talk.
You lost your mom...
Oh Sidney...
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
Are you serious?
You don't still think it was me?
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
Are you alone in the house?
Gotta find me first, you pansy-assed Mama's boy.
I want to talk to you for a second.
Don't...
More of a game, really.
I'm getting scared.
No...
NOOO!
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
No it's not. It was Jason.
What?
Your call.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Twenty-five, huh? In a demographic study I proved to be most popular amongst males, 11-24. I just missed you. Of course, you don't look a day over twelve, except in the upper torso area. Does the force require that you work out?
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
Deputy... good evening.
Mind if I join you?
Can I bring Kenny?
Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago.
I don't think you're so bad.
We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry.
And my Dad? Any word on him?
What about the cellular phone bill?
Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today... damn if I know.
Yes, sir, sheriff.
Yes, sir.
The phone's dead.
Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities.
I'll send you a copy.
Just stay back.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
So who are you?
So where are you?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
LEAVEMEALONE!
...out at the airport...
Twice.
Listen to me, Sid. I found Tatum. She's dead, she's been killed... I think Stu did it.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
The why'd the police let him go?
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
How do you gut someone?
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
He was there, Tatum.
It's alright. I'll get it.
I bet he's pissed.
And you believe it?
Oh, god...
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
I'm in.
Announcing what?
So what?  This victim...
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
What are you talking about?
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
You know that's not true.
I seem to remember knocking on your door.
Sit back.
What the fuck is going on?
Maybe I'm not understanding the question.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
I realize that.
For now.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
Good.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
What?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Nothing.
I know.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
A switchblade.
Bear with me.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
Satisfy our curiosity?
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
And so what?
Him?
What?  Assessing fines?
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
I'm fine.
Looking around... I've got a bad feeling these murders are his life's work.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
One of two things will happen.  We're either going to get John Doe, or he'll finish his series of seven, and this case will go on for years.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
I will.
Oh... um, William.
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
I hate this city.
It just happened to be me...No need to make any more of it...
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
Yes sir...
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
You fit a lot of descriptions.
I thought we were trying to get the girls back -- <U>alive</U>...We jump those Comanches, they'll kill 'em...You know that!
How far's the river from here, Mose?
This an invite to a necktie party, Reverend?
There sure is! I'm going to tell you somethin'...I wasn't going to speak of it...But I'll tell you now. Did you notice them scalps strung on Scar's lance?  Did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance? Long... wavy hair...
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
<U>Cheyenne</U>! What Cheyenne?
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
Because she's my...my...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
What's that?
But I just bought a good blanket.
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
She ain't goin' back to her family, that's certain...not if she took off where the arrow points.
You breeds are all alike -- two drinks an'...
Never heard of him...
Not likely.
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
I got your boy killed.
Well I ain't one of 'em!
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
Come on, say it.  You know...
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
You?
My father was a pilot.  And do I know how to fly?
Making our very own solstice fire.
I just had a really strange experience.
What?
Not a book fair.  I was signing autographs in a department store.
And two months later, we got married.  And all because of one sentence:  "With you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
You know, it's not always easy for me, either.  But at least I try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
No, thanks.  I have everything I need.  Drive safely, you hear?
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
What are you talking about-
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
Oh no, no.  You're not bothering him.  He has lots of time since he's been retired.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
Just call me Elisabeth.
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
I guess someone lost their key. You did get your tetanus shots, I hope?
And the title of this piece?
The speech is excellent.  "Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you!" Excellent and a good length. But then he disappears for the length of a bible.
It's good.
Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
Right you are, governor!
Lady?
Twenty pounds on delivery
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
Well, I am to Deptford now, I leave my respects, Miss Rosaline.
See you in jail.
When I have fifty pounds.
Ten pounds.
Nothing comes.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return. Words will flow like a river. I will see you in a week.
Cut his nose off.
Partners!
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Very well.
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
It is all locked safe in here
What piece? Richard Crookback?
I did not.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
What? Who?
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?!  What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
What do we do now?
Go on.
Good title.
Do you think?
Mercutiogood name.
A different one you haven't written?
"Not having that which, having, makes them short."
I will.
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
When the Queen commands it.
Verona again.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Your Majesty.
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home. WESSEX gives his purse to VIOLA.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam?
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
"What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?"
I have to get back.
A lowly player.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
It is strange to me, too.
Oh
Mr. Henslowe?
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
Orsinogood name
How does it?
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
You flatter, my lord.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
I am going to church.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
My hat?
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
I don't know -- Campbell or something?
Think about it.
Juliet?
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
All right, then, go ahead, telephone. Telephone the police. Try again. No one's going to stand in your way. Go ahead. Tell them there's a suitcase of money and you don't want it.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I don't hear this.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
I don't know.
There was a break-in.
You're sure? There's lots more.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
We just wanted to speak to you.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't know.
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
No, not any more. I just wondered if it would surprise you.
Yes.
Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
Yes.
Just serve.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
She hated you --
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
I don't know. He sounded Swedish. Do you know any Swedish men? Maybe it was just the emotion.
Not usually this drunk.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
OK.
That's not him.
You were magnificent.
Who was it?
No, no, it's different.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He can't stay up there.
I'll wait there.
Alex.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
No.
What?
You were going to say something.
What about?
did you hear anything before he cries?
Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Who said there were four?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
Do you smoke?
OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
No.
Two hundred pounds?
No.
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Eh --
What happened to that guy?
You must be Juliet.
I'd be delighted.
The telephone? It continues to ring.
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
What?
The first one was fine.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Is it real?
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Who?
What do you expect me to do about it?
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
It turned out to be cancer.
I gotta talk to you.
Calm down, baby.
I don't want to place you in any position --
You're looking great, baby.
What about?
Why don't you see Lester?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I hope she's all right.
Well she...
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
Her?
Hello.
No thanks.
Don't make conversation with me.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
You think that's funny, don't you?
Right.
They are?
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Buffums?
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
He's a very private person, actually.
You going to tell him?
I'd cut it...
No, I'm sure.
Yeah... I mean great.
And what?
Did I what?
I don't want to... I swear...
I know... you don't know, I know.
What are you talking about?
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
You don't do that anymore, do you?
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
Mmmm --
-- do you want ice?
It's too late...
Don't go, Jackie...
What?
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- how did you get here?
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Great, great. I hope you make it.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
George, I don't --
What?
How?
What about me?
-- Sure.
Of course I like children.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
How did it go at the bank?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Egypt!
Honey, have they offered you the job?
Your advice!
Neither do I, baby.
Who?
A business meeting, I told you that.
Look at the way I live.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
Commercials.
-- go ahead.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
Jesus.
That's all you've got to say?
Did you?
What did you say?
Sure.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
When?
I know what you mean.
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
I'm not anti-Establishment.
What, do you think I planned it?
Didn't they tell you?
No thanks.
Okay, thanks.
Who?
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
George is going to open a shop.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
What's that?
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
You know what's wrong.
I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
I'll call you.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Well, you know what I mean.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Honey?
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
Well, there was this one time --
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
Didn't you have any panties on?
What did you do?
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
Is he an enemy?
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
You're going.
No... how long did you say?
No, it's not that...
John...
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Well you should have eaten your breakfast.
Come here for a minute, first.
Do you feel bad?
Do you like this hotel?
What?
No, Dad.
Yes, Dad.
French Fries and Ketchup.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Tony.
Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, Mom.
Danny, come here!
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
Well how can I repay you?
Advocaat is it?
Fine.
Yes, sir.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
Grady... oh.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Nice to meet you.
God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
Now I'm awfully glad you asked me that, Lloyd, because I just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  I was afraid they were going to be there until next April.  So here's what: you slip me a bottle of Bourbon, a glass and some ice.  You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?  You're not to busy, are you?
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
Absolutely nothing.  How is he?
Good.
Yes.
How do you like it?
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Give me the bat.
Yes?
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
They'll love it.
No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Well, it's very... homely.
Uncle Al-
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
Blue. This blue.
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because I promised, but you two are going to bed. Go on, now, scoot.
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
That's what my sister says, too. Pretty soon I'm going to start checking the mirror to see if I'm turning green.
Rats...
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Sure.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
What the hell does that matter?
Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
You want to know what I think?
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
Well... thank you.
You know what we're saying!
SING!
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
And you listen to that?
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
With love.
You can handle this.
What?
What did who say?
Vince...
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
Yes?
Good evening, Vincent.
Oh my! 
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
No. HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING
Chops?
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
And we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  And so you truly need our prayers.
That man -- who is he?
Enough jabber.
Whatever.
You're a ringer.  She brought you in to replace me.  Out with the old.
Again!
You re okay -- for a civilian.
I... I...
Excuse me?
What?
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
Give me a C.  A C!
We're nuns!
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
Don't you know it!
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
What?
What? 
Yes.  Until breakfast.
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Useless distractions.
Come, Sister.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted the entire choir!
You have a phone call.
A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
Saving you.  Move!
Oh?
I'm a Christian.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
He didn't do you a favor.
Get a stenographer.
Okay -- no limo.
What're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt.  Go.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
How?
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
You won't even tell us?
We didn't tell you what?
Yeah...
Maybe pants.
Which one!
Which one?
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
Neither did you!
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
Yes?
Which convent was that, Sister?
He's decent.
Maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
She wasn't a nun?
She's our inspiration!
And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Yes?
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Well enough.  Your gathering does honor to the deceased.
You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
A diseased monster.
Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance.
What of it?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
The militia?
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
Up.
It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
Should we go back?
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul.  We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths?
What does it mean?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
I doubt that's the end.
The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call "friend," he misplaces a good portion of jealousy.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside.  Can't you see what is inexplicable?
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
And, what did he say?
Yes, actually.
To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
You are from the Hollow?
Leave me.  You are not welcome here.
The Horseman.  Yes.
May I see my mother?
She did not do it... please listen...
I can't remember.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
What you got in there, warshing?
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
It's too big.
You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Don't tell me what to do.
What do you want, hun?
Would y'all like that?
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
I get nervous, that's all I know.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
I aim to kill you with it.
Why? Hi, Karl.
Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
I did live there in the state hospital.
You told me to come by.
I thought they was.
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
I like the way you talk.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
Naw.
I don't reckon I know.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
I wadn't thinkin' about nothin' else just like you told me I'd do.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Okay.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Mama?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I love you, too, Mama.
Yes, I guess you are.
I reckon.
I reckon I can just walk around till the mornin'. Or set and read me a book somewhere.
Yes sir.
Tolerable, I reckon.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
All right then.
Ma'am?
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
I know.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Why won't he talk to women?
Melvin, go get Karl and take him down to the old classroom.
Before they were married?
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
Actually, I'm his father.
I confess.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
What's the difference?
I wouldn't think of it.  See you around, fellas.
Yeah, I did.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
Help? Hmm. It's possible. What did you have in mind?
Fuck you, kid.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
You're looking good, Auggie.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You don't give up, do you?
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
For keeps.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
She upped and married some other cat after I joined the navy. By the time I got my discharge, though, she was divorced. Her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel.
She made a play for me after I got back, but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration. Every time we got into a clinch, I'd start thinking about that hole in her head, that empty socket with the glass eye in it. An eye that couldn't see, an eye that couldn't shed any tears. The minute I started thinking about it, Mr. Johnson would get all soft and small. And I can't see getting married if Mr. Johnson isn't going to be in tiptop shape.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
Huh?
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
And these?
How the hell did you get into the building?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
I'm telling you. I don't know anyone named Thomas.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
And?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
Jesus.
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
It'll cost you five bucks.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Are you making fun of me? I won't be mocked. Do you hear me? I won't let no punk kid stand there and mock me!
Yeah? And why is that?
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
That's true. But I also owe you something, and I'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job.  What is it? Family problems? Money problems?
And where do Momsie and Popsie live?
In Manhattan?
The what?
You can't be more specific than that?
But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
He's dead?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
Why don't you go to the police?
If they put this Creeper in jail, then you'd be safe.
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
You work too hard, you know that?
The inspiration.
No way.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
Is it yours?
It wasn't my fault.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Yes, please.
Keep it tonight.  We'll catch fish. I'll see ya back on the docks...
Oh, yeh?
I'm a hemotologist, not a detective.
Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
Why not?
Well, it seems to me...
You're implying th...
Easy.  Slow is best.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
You've been busy with that trial, I suppose.  Such a travesty...
Oh, in a heartbeat.
He said, 'Could it be somebody hit him?'  And I said, 'You want to play Sherlock Holmes, here?'
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Like you couldn't believe.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
I had a spare battery in my shed. I brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
You're wondering why I held it.
To my father.  Everything counts.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  Was never found.  So we have to ask...
Still lashed to the mast.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
He hit his head.  On the way in.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Your daddy played.  I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
Mr. Gudmundsson, we <u>know</u> what that jury is looking at.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
I don't think so.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
He had no reason to.
That's all he said.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Why?
Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
All right, girls - from the top again.
Those two musicians from the garage!
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
Quiet - I'm thinking.
I told you - it's a sure thing.
With you.
Don't you remember?  He has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
We're not too late, are we?
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
Knock it off, will you?
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
And I'm Daphne.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
Tore off one of my chests.
You better come help me.
Now you tore the other one.
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
Good night, Josephine.
Daphne -  Go on - tell me all about him.
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
I'm engaged.
I am.
You think he's too old for me?
Security.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
I may throw up.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If there's anything I can do for you -
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
Interesting.
I have a very low resistance.
You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
I'm just going to get some ice.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Yes.  For a whole year.
Help yourself.
You don't say.
Why?
Oh, you don't get off that easy.
Yes, Osgood?
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
It's three weeks in Florida -
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
I'm not very bright, I guess.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Have you ever been with a male band?
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
I'll say.
What's in Florida?
Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Just my feminine intuition.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
My fault.
Why?
Not very likely.
Not at all.
No, my flag steward.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
For your own amusement?
You're society girls?
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
I beg your pardon?
Yes, you're in the way.  He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Shells?  Whatever for?
Oh, Josephine - just imagine - me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio, on a millionaire's yacht.  If my mother could only see me now -
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
It's more like a mental block.  When I'm with girls, it does nothing to me.
You poor, poor boy.
Thanks just the same.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
What is it?
It's like smoking without inhaling.
I must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Did you have a nice time?
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
I told you - I'm not very bright.
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
Booze.
Coffee?
Who's going to raid a funeral?
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
I sleep with my spats on.
You and who else?
Yes, sir.
I come to Grandma's funeral.  Here's your admission card.
If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
So now I got all those coffins on my hands - and I hate to see them go to waste.
Its not me. I swear. Its her. Shes magic.
Still--
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Im a hooker.
Dont be ridiculous. Its late and the place is empty. Just take my car.
Oh, shut up. Youre an optician.
Shrink, actually.
Yeah?
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
Not for a dog.
When we were together I was too here, now Im not here enough.
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. Its no big deal. I promise.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
You have feet?
Really?  Dont get too attached.
He was pretty drunk, but I think hes still crazy about you.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
Its okay. Hell, Ive never paid for it. But please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
A weekend?
I think thats disgusting.
Oh, no.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
I disappear. Its not about me.
Spontaneously combust?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Its complicated, Dad.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
Hard.
At least somebodys using the damn thing.  I was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
Sometime, but not like this.
I try...
Colored.
What's his name?
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
I have a mother and her name is Rebecca -- My father's name is Nathan Lee Morgan, and...
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
But where is my daddy!?
She was dirty and wet...
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
NO! N-O, NO!
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Yes, sir...
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
I think so...
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Just do like I tell you -- I'll get word to you through the visitin' preacher.
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
What happened afta that?
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
They gone to the field...
Great, son -- not like wakin' up in jail. For a minute or two, didn't quite know where I was, but when I saw your face lookin down on me, made me know right away the day was gonna be a good one, and it all belonged to me!
Thank you, Daddy...
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
Yes, Daddy! Yes!
What's that, son?
Then why don't he holler like he usta?
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
They probly thought you was crazy.
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
Ike, you could make a song outta that!
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
I wanta see Nathan.
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
Doggy.
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
Eric!
I said -
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
Oh.
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Whoops.
No you can't Kenny!
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Sure, hon. Goodnight.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
Help yourself prickfuck!
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
Norwegian Ass Raper.
This is it! The time for action is NOW!!  <b>Something must be done! This is like a spreading rash! They're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of smut and sex and poo! I believe the good fight has begun! Something must be done!</b>
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
MPH RM!!!
Then move out of the way.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
You bastards!!
It isn't fair!
How do we do that?
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
Huh?
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
Cheers, Terrance!
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
Hey, come here, guy.
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
I know.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Don't call me dumb!
Hey, relax guy!
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
That's nice, Stan.
Cool!
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
My grandfather.  My God, I can't tell you what a fan I am of yours! You were magnificent in Deadly Gamble.
Of course, of course...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
It certainly is.
Uh...
That's very professional sounding of you, Taylor.
Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
Let's get something straight, Chappy!
I don't have a problem with it. Besides, you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
Probably come through the wall I suppose.
It depends on the condition of the ship.  If I could get to one of the suit compartments I could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry.
Wait.
Helllp!
Don't worry about me.  There's still a chance I can issue a distress signal.
Over and out.
And so far.
It would matter to us.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
How am I supposed to know?
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Yes.  You can enjoy some wonderful views from there.
Find your bowler?
He's my dad.
You said it would be unethical to help me. You call dwarf bowling ethical!
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
It was a clearance.
Wait! That's an aria!
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
It's mine.
The small ball.
What's it look like to you?
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
I was beaten on a shot named after my own dad. The moment passes. Theo turns and climbs into his car. He looks up at Buzz.
See ya 'round Maynard.
Bowlers don't go around killing other bowlers. He's only a fan, Millie. I'll give him some tips and an autograph and he's outta here.
I gotta go. Love ya mom.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
Buzz Fazeli.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
He told me to play Blue-Face with Buzz. I like games.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
SHEILA!
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
No!
You know who I am?
I heard you've been having a little trouble with the Congress.  Theo pulls his eyes off Sheila. Kastle walks Theo past pairs of bowlers.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
That's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?  Now go take out your "big four", darling.  Come on, we're making her nervous.
I like the sport the way it is.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
That's right, sugar, find the grip that's right for you. Then grasp firmly. The camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green.
No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
I couldn't kill Buzz. I need his help. Theo helps Millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car.
Where can I find him?
Coming right up.
Mine, and they never tip.
What do you want with my dad?
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
The mental hospital.
So, what about you?
Why should I help that old fuck.
Too late for what, Sheila?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
I said back away.
Two and a half days?
Yeah.  I heard you.
What if it attacks?
Sure.  Each time it started fires inside the habitat.
Nothing else.
Press?  No, I haven't.
Hold on --
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
It doesn't make any sense.
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
Take a look.
What do you mean, he's missing?
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
But sir, I think it's imperative.  I think the messages, the animals we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- I think they're all related.
Jerry?
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
They're coming.
Well, where the fuck is he?
Then how can it be chipped?
Yes, Harry.
Ladies and Gentlemen...
How do you mean, strange?
She's not gonna know, sir.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
Considered what?  That it's American? How would you think it's American?
What sub?
I love secrets.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
Yeah.  Drowning.
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
What?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
Beth.
What?
You bastard.
Beth --
In case you die, too?
I would.  But my suit --
Still clear.
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
We must've had it delivered then.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
You think, in the sphere --
But why is he doing it?
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
Sintag.
Tarazine?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
You're not sorry.  You're scared.  You're a psychologist, Norman.  You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth.  And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
How's Harry?
You think I manifested the snakes?
Is it?
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Beth --
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
It's an American spacecraft.
That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Fine.  I'm fine.
I'm not being defensive.
I'm fine.
To what?
Which one?  Let me get the list out.
But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
What noise?
You don't understand about the sphere.
What happened to her?
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
I don't think so.
Hold on.
I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
What is it, Harry?
You're not afraid of the water, are you, Norman?
That's right.
But it's impossible.
Think about it.
Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
If it is an alien spacecraft --
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
"We are friends".
Really?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
He's a pussy.
You mean a picture?
Please, Ted.
This is like nursery school.
Unless it's an act.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Four.  Four years --
I don't know.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
Not bad.
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
You could put it that way.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
You mean I generate an energy field?
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
How can you store an energy field within you?
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Yes, sir.
I'll make a report later.
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
Then I think we're due the reward you offered... and it had better be substantial after what we've been through.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
Not if this tunnel deadends.
Move out of the way!
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
We'll send a squad up.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
They'll find its weakness.
It would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are... Otherwise we'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system... What a waste...
There'll be time for that later. Now let's get out of here.
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I don't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Something... I've got...you don't.
It's what I deserve.
Death to all bugs !
I didn't see him !
We're the old men, Ace.
Sorry, son. I can't do it. You signed the 1240/A. It would be illegal.
You got it bad.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Your father will never let you.
I got Games & Theory.
Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we'd run into each other...
Hey, check it.
THERE !	GRAVITY FIELD... IT'S BIG !
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
A funeral.
I don't know, Zander.
Just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
I'll meet you outside.
I can't help it.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
Yes, ma'am.
Ibanez...LET'S GO !
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Sure.
Guess you gotta go.
No thanks, Diz.
Flip six, three hole.
You got it.
You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you're only proving one thing, Johnny.
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
Looks like rain.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Good, because you're going to Harvard, and that's the end of it.
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
I've made a mess of things. I've been so stupid...
This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant John Rico. I've assumed command on this mission.
Been better, buddy.
This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
What is it, Rico ?
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Yes, sir...
Yes, sir.
We're not leaving you here, sir !
Give'em hell, sir !
That unit no longer functions. I have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting Enterprise.
To join with him.
You may proceede.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
<U>Answer</U>!
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Forcefields, full remaining strength...! Total reserve!
They could have many ways of destroying things, Mr. Decker.
This served the purpose.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator.
Decker....!
Twelve seconds...!
Viewer, standard ahead.
Aye, sir.
Intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center. Energy of a type entirely un- known to me.
Our... 'insignificance'?
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
'Is this all I am? Is there not more?'
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
To you, sir?
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!
Helm ready, sir.
Evening, Cal.  Would you tell me about it?
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Who?
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
Of course.
And likewise.
Mmm.
You'd know better'n me.
But but but but but it's better <u>without</u>...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Cast stood me up.
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
I used to go out with a politician.
I can't get it to come out right.
Hi.
You know what else a man can do?
Yes...
Not without a rolltop desk.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
I saw...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
Carla was in the car, right?
...you think that's right...
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
Courthouse back in town.
Can't...can't you build the Old Mill?
And I need a drink.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
...they run on water.
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
I'm having dinner with W...
Thanks, honey, but, next time, bring two, save yourself a trip.
Tell it with <u>pictures</u>.
And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
Joe, the writer?
I've always seen that.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
You have to what?
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
It's night.
I, actually yes.
But we...
I...
How can I thank you?  How can I repay you for this part?  It's a...what a, thank you for this part.  The first scene at the Old Mill...
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
It isn't <u>right</u>.  I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
I know, I know.
...yes...
I'm only trying to...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
You were in the car with Bob?
He told you that...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
You should.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
Get Mitch Cohn on the phone in New York, tell him she's breaking her contract and we're very up...
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I'm out.
The girl was in the car.
I have to tell the truth.
So be it.
For what cause?
I...
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
55 days and I take home the camera. I got an idea for a <u>product</u> placement...
Would you, tell the guy, get the A.D., someone, somewhere where we can <u>get</u> <u>away</u>, something, I want, you know, last day before the shooting, get away, forget it, have some local food.  You want...
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
...not the Lazyboy...
So we just got lucky.
Yes, I hear it.
It takes all kinds.
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
Waal, what was the per-screen average...?
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
That will never happen.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
And...?
She is but an arriviste.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
I'm not.
Until he's old enough to read.
Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
And this is my room so get out!
See, I...
IT'S NOT YOUR <u>FAULT</u>!!
Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
You owe me a quarter.
Alright starve.
Thank you Ben.  Annabelle!
I knew where I was all the time.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
How do you know?
Rache can do that part.
But you can still see him.
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Let's take our best shot.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
Duncan.  My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again.  Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
Remarried.  There is no move.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
And I'm supposed to care.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
A lot smaller.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Look, I...
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration.  I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
I did it for her.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
...it's my problem, too.
You're not dying.
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
Toi.  They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
You mean, after I'm dead?
Is that what he told you?
Who in the world <u>is</u> he?
Give 'em my number.
Worked.  Like a charm.
So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck.
That's not wh...
Double.
You'll learn.
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
They don't hate you --
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Rache, get out of th...
I think so...What do you think?
I know that.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
Hey. What's up?
Like what?
No.
We had to work. My family was poor.
This is work.
My baby.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
I am sure.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
Nothing, I guess
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Well, I need to see this with an audience!
Is everything OK?
Huh?
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
Scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
The same.
Just the same.
Yeah?
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
One in a million recover.
OK!
Sure, Dad.
What are you doing here?
Uh huh.
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Again!
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
That's what I was gonna ask you.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Eight, six, and four.
Maybe she has caller ID.
No, thanks.
Yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
So where'd you get in?
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Don't be. Your movie's a hit.
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
What happened?
Used to Filmore, used to.
What are you talking about?
Well Cooper...
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
It seems to me we are just sailing away. They haven't sunk us yet, have they? Besides, don't you worry your pretty little head about that.  It's all been taken care of.
She's still alive.
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
I'm in to the directory but they've codified the stockpile--numerically.
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
That's right, fella.
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
That's government property, Major.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
I know that, sir.
Ask away, Major.
Do you remember what Clemenceau once said about war?
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
That's close enough, Major.
Our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy, wouldn't they?
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
But we mean it because we are a peace- loving country.  Are they a peace-loving country, Major.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
I presume the planes are armed?
And I suppose you're going to tell me you don't know what the three-letter code is.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
Naturally I am, sir.
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Lothar, take your checks now.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
What?
Missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Check your code again.  No one at base would pull a stunt like that, Terry.
Ready, Major.
Lieutenant Toejam's going to help you in a minute.  Can you check your ECM?
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
I've got one.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Everything still checks out okay.
What do you mean?
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
Well, I just wanted you to know how I felt. Hell, I know Air Command wouldn't have taken you if you weren't okay.  And don't think I don't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of Negro descent.
But who would be chosen?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Knock yourself out.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Intense.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Typical male.
Yeah, when's he coming?
A cloud?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Oh, untrue, Jeffster. I think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where I had fucked two girls.
What?
Oh, I'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. Oh, oh, Pony, come on, give it to me! Stud! Oh!
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
Okay, okay.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No.
No, no.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
No.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
You know?
She's dead.
Jeff! Let's go!
Yeah, right, publicist.
Really?
Shit.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Glad it's okay.
Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
Good. See you later.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Please.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
Okay.
Hi.
What about me? I don't have a car.
Oh, yeah?
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
It's a mistake to think that.
Thank you.
He causes problems. He was here earlier.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Why don't you write a song about Sandra Berhard's salad, asshole?
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
What are, what are you doing? Look, Tim, just go home. Alright. Go home and sleep it off.
Just go home, alright?
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Look, your trespassing.
I don't know.
Look, why do you care, huh?
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Hey!
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
It was just something that got out of hand. Did anyone get hurt?
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
Mm-mm.
You do.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
I, yeah.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
No, maybe not though. That, that's what I'm trying to say.
Just go.
Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
So how's college?
No, man, I mean it. You're a good writer. I remember those things you'd write during honors English. Funny shit.
Yeah.
I don't know. Uh, I'm an artist, I guess. You know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
Oh, yeah.
Burnfield. No place like it.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
You know what? Go ahead and shoot me. Go ahead! Fucking shoot me! Come on! Come on, man! Come on!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Hey.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
If...
That's because I am.
Nobody's fucking anybody!
Where do you get your ideas?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Don't do that, man, okay?
Oh, yeah, drunk on the corner, man. Hey, why don't you buy another beer. It's on me, okay?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Hey, Tim.
You know the fuck not.
Don't swear it's impolite.
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
It's twins!!
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
No...I've been pregnant.
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
And they get caught!
But Di, all this food reminds me of how much I want to teach our baby.
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
Diane, there's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins.  Now, if you guys were really friends, you'd remind her to take these.
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
Oh - okay, we ain't done with this... Those babies are gonna get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load!  We're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals!  I'm gonna visit my mom!
Oh thank Buddha it's you, Kim-Lo, I'm being held against my will, my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call...
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
That's okay, Hannah.  It was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies.  Sex - you can learn from movies.  But robberies?  There's no way.
Hold on...
Kansas?
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
Uh...Yeah, Grandma.  She doesn't mean that.  Kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke.
Definitely old.
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
All of you!
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Before you?  Whoo-hoo!
Hey, don't "mouthy shit" me - I'm outta here.
Hi, Artie.
Where's the bar?
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
What's wrong with it?
Why, you sweet kid.
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
What teacher?
You did?
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Who's who?
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
Nice job.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Whose?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
You'd better.  I'm very angry.
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
I knew there was something wrong with them.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
They'll love it in Pomona.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
Just a scene I cut out.
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
What's wrong with It?
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me.  DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
Yes, I am, Norma.
You think I made that up about the gun...
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
I sure turned into an interesting driveway.
There are no locks anywhere in this house.
Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Mr. Sheldrake, I don't want you to think I thought this was going to win any Academy Award.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Yes, Madame.
Who?
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
But which one?
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
Sorry, mistress.
He will be. In about five minutes.
No, a super girl.
Eliminate her.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
There's no need. I learned the Craft from my 						grandmother.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
What do you want?
It's for your own protection.
Who didn't?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
You don't like me? You hate me?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Well...I guess one is all right.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
But I don't understand.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I don't see why not.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
What?
How do I fight it?
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I did.
I'll drink to that.
And you think you're in love.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
I don't want your help.
Well...I guess I can't.
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
Why George, are you proposing?
Nice to meet you.
Theories?
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
How do you know?
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
It's going to be a tree, I think.
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
You sure?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Mr. Danvers called. I'll get a new one with the insurance money. B.F.D.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
Throw him out.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
Earth? You crossed the dimension barrier? By yourself?
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
Criminals.
The Phantom Zone overlooks everywhere.. If you have the right tools.
Why?
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Not doing this for you. Just sick of this place, that's all. Wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. Boring!
Don't stop. Keep moving.
Brad Wilson.
I seem to be.
Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
Too much mayonnaise?
You thought that?
Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer myself.
There's a lot of choices here.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
But if you wouldn't mind settling for me --
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
Kent!
Mom and I do this all the time.
We get together sometimes.
What's that?
What are you doing?
Nope, but --
I know, I'm the fault.
What about this week's check?
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
One.  And a half.
Say who?
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
I'm tryin' to.
Black or regular?
Not "What." Don't need a genius to figure out "what." Need a genius to figure out "where."  He says I'm a genius, your don --  Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!  See, if y'all don't want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. Some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ROSS It's got to be someplace you can sneak into.
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
We've already got some.
Exactly. Stoned mother.
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Will you stop interrupting ?!  You will command the pumps to stop pumping.
A story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  The big dance! The Homecoming Game! Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!
Anytime.
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
Tell me.
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
And he use to be such a sweetie pie! What's wrong with him the last two weeks?
Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's after our skin!
You've got to pick three more numbers.
Missing????
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
Don't cry, Bubba.
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
Where did it come from?
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
We can get to work on that oil!
Wait for Gus to get here, sis.
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Maybe you wanted to.
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
You're not selfish at all.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Uh...home...
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
It's beautiful.
How the hell would I know? I was in high school back in those days.
Give it another ten minutes. If we don't --  Hell, I'll tell him.  Pete? If we haven't got anything new in the next ten minutes just go with the wire service copy under the 40 pt. banner and run the picture for three columns.  Kent,	I need a background story for the page 3 sidebar. Give me every thing you know about this terrorist group.
Maybe we just don' t know his game plan.
I asked the right question.
To ski?
Oh! That black box in our cell?
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
What do you want?
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Perhaps a small . . . incentive, your 									Ultimate. A tiny bauble to help me jog my memory . . .
And so I was yesterday. And the day before.
Sentimental idiot.
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
"Super-sucker . " For once, Lex Luthor was right.
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be writing about. C'mon, let's dance.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those knees up!
If you say so. Here goes.
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
Like me?
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Go on . . .
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
. . . And  very nave!
Superman gets mail here?
An angle?
But why the hair?
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
You're just an experiment, freako!
What?
You are . . .
Wait! Not yet! Back!
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
No . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
Stop saying you know when I say 'y'know.' I know you know.  Yes, I know you're here, Otis. What do you want, a brass band?
Bunkers!
Nobody else.
We're running out of smoke.
Anyway, we Kent's don't like showoffs, ain't that so? A body's got to be humble even if he knows that he's better'n his neighbors.
Not really, no.
But otherwise it's swell.
What the  --  !
Oh.
Oh sure. A man flies in the sky like a pigeon and it wasn't a trick.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Screaming
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
First the pets, Otis.
You're on.
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
We just take it?
Ready.
You?! How about me?
A night on the town instead of under it?
Yours not to reason why, Miss Teschmacher. Relax! Enjoy it!  Just look at that smog!
Tea?
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
What's your name, boy?
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
-- as we will be.
He will be odd, different.
How good it felt!
He is. Usually.
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
You think they're strange?
Thirty-five.
Yes. Although I can get a headache just like anyone.
Only when somebody shoots them at me.
Not there!  A pine tree in Death Valley? Idiot! This is for the North Woods section!
Excellent, Otis.  But what took you so long?
I'll never forget you for that, Mr. Luthor.
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I guessed she'd been bitten by an insect, but there was no doctor. The nearest hospital was forty miles away, and Zoe was continuing to swell.  Klara took her in her arms and tried to breast-feed her, while I dialed the hospital.  I finally got a doctor on the line.  He sounded young, but cool.  He was confident, but there was a nervousness.  He have been an intern.  This was the first time he ever had to deal with anything like this.  He wanted to seem like he knew what he was doing, but he was just as scared as I was.
Mitchell.  It was nice to see you again, Ally.
Why are you telling me this?
Was it good?
Yeah.
It does concern me.
How?
Why not?
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Why?
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
Did they give him special care?
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling?  Who should care about what I'm feeling?
Hi, Dolores.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
How long has Dolores been driving that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times has she steered clear of danger? What went wrong that morning?
No.  A little sugar though.
I feel like a princess.
It's the truth.
What's a ditty again?
Oh.
Okay.
What, Mason?
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
I object to that form of question. Note that.
'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy? 'Cause you think I've got a needle stuck in my arm?  Is that what you're thinking, Daddy?
Yes.
I...I just need to know what state you're in so I know...how to talk to you...how to act...
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Yes.
You can't ask me that!  Not anymore! You asked me what I wanted.  Not what I wanted it for.  I want money.
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
No.
In what way?
And where did you sit that morning?
You remember that much?
Why were you scared?
Dolores was driving too fast.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Yes.
You mean it?
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals.  It's like the biggest thing in her life.
Nothing.
Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
Oh.  I better get some spackle.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
How will he do that?
As opposed to this T.V.?
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
I don't know.
You don't know that.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Alone or surrounded?
The next time you want information, Falco, don't scratch for it like a dog - ask for it like a man!
I'm late for a date with a dame.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
No, I'm not.  I'm not!
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
J.J., Steve isn't...
Now don't kid a kidder.
This man is not for you, Harvey, and you shouldn't be seen with him in public.  Because that's another part of a press agents life - he digs up scandal among prominent men and shovels it thin among the columnists who give him space.
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
Not just this minute, J.J....
Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
Are you finished?
When?
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Presumably yours...  That's according to St. Dallas.
He's leaving early.  After this "set".  He'll be out in a couple of minutes...
At the bar - Sidney...
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Take a top coat.
Yes.
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Why not you?
Don't you think it's about time you shut yours?  Who are you to tell a man like Frank D'Angelo to shut up?!
Speak to this lad, Al, ... to Mr. Falco.
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Chickie, I'll have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you...!
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
Yeah.  A coincidence you should run into the very man you've been ducking all week!  This is my press agent, Joan.
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Steve, stop it please...
Not what you're doing now.  At least don't ask me - don't ask him. You're fighting for your life! What do YOU want to do?
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
No one must follow your work.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Max.
Anything it samples by physical contact.
No.  Only an object of equal size.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Right.
What?
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
Smile?
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
No.
Yeah.  I guess so.  My mom says when I'm, like, 45, I think, I send him back through time to 1984.  But right now he hasn't even been born yet.  Man, is messes with your head.  Where's that other bolt?  Thanks.  Mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, I guess.  I see her crying sometimes.  She denies it totally, of course.  Like she says she got something in her eye.
Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
Dyson.
What?
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
No!  Don't kill him!
SHOOT!!!!
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
And what it that?
Open the goddamn door!
Ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
And Skynet fights back.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Respect your elders and your betters!
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
Some.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
Yes.
Major Richards said he'd call to let us know.
Major, I don't see how this line of questioning could...
Colonel. Pleasure.
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
Then you're going to kill me.
Yes.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
No. Ours was damaged.
If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
May I ask a question?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
Yes, von der Null.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
You like the women, don't you, Wilhelm?
I don't understand what you mean.
Bruckner's Seventh. The Adagio.
Helmuth.
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
Yes.
Come to the office, please.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
Wrong.
You're a big help.
I hate the beige one.
What's it to ya?
No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
Right.
I don't understand...
White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
What?
You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
It was an honor.  A chance to meet the legend.  Sarah Connor.  Who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. From when he was a kid.  When you were in hiding, before the war.
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
Okay.  Talk some more.
Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.
What's that?
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
I want it to be over for you.
No.  Never.
Ticklish?
Cover...our footsteps...
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
Then how are you supposed to get back?
Why?
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the ...bodies.
I just called.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
I apologized, I offered to help.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?
Why not?
If there was one.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
You first.
You pull me up.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
Can we talk?
Come here...
What's wrong?
Get out.
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
I know things... like who you can trust.  Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
What do we do?
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Where'd you get that gun?
Just... wait.  Just wait!  Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
What are you doing?
Fuck you.
You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
That's not true...
Big family... small?
Single?
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
I don't need anything from you.  I was laying on a beach somewhere in Spain, naked, and, it hit me -- Nickie's birthday.  So, here I am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. Not necessarily in that order.
Fun?
Okay.
Are you still on mediction?
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know...
Stop it!
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Have you gone to the police?
Yes, very lucky.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
Yes.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
What is?
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
What kind of vacation?
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
The key?
No, you didn't...
Thank you.  Goodnight.
I'm not sure.
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
It was a misunderstanding.
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
You're joking.
You warm my heart.
Greetings fellow insomniac.
What?
I did okay.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
There's a carriage house around back.
It's a question.
Just stay there, Nell!
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
And why didn't Marrow tell <u>us</u>? Doesn't he trust women?  That fuck.
Luke.
No.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
All night?
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
I don't know.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
Can't say.  Haven't been here that long.  Well, it's Labor Day, gotta get to work.
Why would we --
No one will come any nearer than that.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
Why?
Oh, god.
Come over here.
Where do we go?
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Been to the Boat Show.
Lookin' good.
Round about, yeah.
No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that.
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
Those aren't guards.  They're valets.
Faith.
He's gotta know why.
Uh-huh.
Really.
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
You look alike.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
That's not what I heard.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie?
She never told Eddie, though.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren --
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Have you ever known me not to be.
Depends, don' it.
It's true.  Has to be said.  I got off to a slow start.
I've 'ardly ever left it.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
How do you know?
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Eh?
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
Ian?
I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Five thousand.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
Avery said she was tight with his daughter.
Any happier than any other asshole in life.
Lemme break.
Something's on.
No trouble.
You know I don't live with him.
Are you finished?
I don't.
About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
<u>Why</u> then.  Why did you do it!
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
We've certainly missed you.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Geez, Mr Crane.
Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
Did she make mistakes?
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
No. I--tell me--
Yeah.
Cash.
It's OK.
Look, uh... Creighton...
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
But it's...
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
So you paid the guy?
Told what?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
Mm.
How are you?
What happened to you?
Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting you Freddy Riedenschneider.
...OK.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
I don't know. I don't think so.
OK. Boy. Jesus!
I'm fine. Thanks.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
I know who you are, Mr Crane.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Uh-huh.
Now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. For the kids there's the Butch, or the Heinie...
Yeah.
Whuddya mean?
OK.
Yeah.
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
Huh? No.
He's the dead guy.
Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
Uh... you're under arrest.
No.
I'm in.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Where's the walk-in safe?
Like hell!
Can't really focus on birds at the moment, Pendergast.  I'm tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
Then you won't like this one.  It's a piece of shit.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
Correct.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
I'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that John is gone.
May I see that?
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
Got my hands full here.
I know.
The thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
I'm not giving up.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
No, Dr. Frock.  You can't.
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
Holy mother, what is that?
He's right.  Follow me.
Someone's been murdered.  Not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  Torn limb from limb.  There's talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
What kind of hormones?
Yes, he's fine.  Greg... take care of yourself!
You were behind me?  Running after me?
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
What are you going to do?
It's scared of me.
It's coming.  Run.
What?
<i>Fiji.</i>
It doesn't matter.  I'll make other arrangements.
All prop cars accounted for?
A window onto the human condition?
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
Who knew that a show originally meant to last one year - "Bringing Up Baby" - would turn into a "cradle to grave" concept.  He is in fact the first child in the world to be legally adopted by a corporation.
We accept the reality of the world with which we're presented.  As the show expanded, naturally we were forced to manufacture ways to keep Truman in Seahaven - demonstrating that every venture is accompanied by a risk.
Let's take another call.  London, England, you're on "Tru Talk."
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
Yeah, what happened?
--Truman, what are you doing here?
Are you okay?  You look like shit.
No.  Truman, if this is another one of your fantasies...
It's a surprise.
They're...  perfect.  Thank you.
I won't be late.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
I won't be here Sunday.
What?!
You blaming me for the traffic?
I've changed my mind again.  What's New Orleans like this time of year?  Mardi Gras.  Or let's just see where the road takes us.
I've got something to tell you.  You'd better sit down.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
Things always do--when you look back.
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
Who?
I don't understand.
You can count on it.
Yeah.
Yes.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
Kurtzweil, we think.
We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
Show you right on a map.
Standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
I know the name. Why?
And one little boy.
Do you?
Not according to the men in blue.
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
How?
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
Yes. On the Texas border. Some kind of experiment. Something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
Did you find something?
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
Scully, I found the bomb.
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
They have divided us, Mulder. They're splitting us up.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
Get dressed, Scully.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
I can't really talk right now.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
All the equipment is brand new.
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
I have no idea.
Come on!
Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately.
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
I've got no allergy. Something... this... Mulder... I think... I think you should call an ambulance.
General McAddie's.
Thank you.
And they want to blame us?
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
How?
We've been forced to reassess our role in Colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
A pocketful of rye...
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
Shush.
No.
I've got to feed my cat.  Besides, I want to get to bed early.
I'll be fine.
No.  No.
What happened?
Four and twenty blackbirds...
What's wrong?
I don't need them anymore...
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
I realize that...
What happened to Charles Gish?
I can't leave him!
Yep.  Eloped.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
No problem.
Mocky-Lock.
Just graduated law school.  Single mom. Had a two-year-old daughter.
You're kidding me.
I think that's the whole point.
Absolutely.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
Awaiting his arrival.
They think you did it.
Sit down.
Do you understand German?
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
I was told there were only two men there.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Where is she?
We're both in it, Harry.
Wait here.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Have you been seeing Major Calloway again?
And my passport?
No.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
I don't know.
I don't want it.
I don't...
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
Holly Martins.
Ever seen one?
Well, you could say that murder was part...
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
A bruised lip.
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.
Are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
How about the doorway?
Yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, I suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.
Well, there's not much time.
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Certainly.
Of course, of course, of course.
Who?
Have you, Sergeant? Author - Martins. Thank you, Sergeant.
And - Anna...
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
But he said he died instantaneously.
What's the name of this girl?
How do you do.
Vinkel.
I have guests waiting.
Hear the details.
Yes, yes, I remember you.
You saw it?
Who else?
Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
Well make it your business.
Not the sort of thing I should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. Humanity's duty.
Funny?
Not necessarily.
Joseph Harbin.
Not when I get interested.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
Just take it, OK.
We moved rooms because of him.
Of course, but look; all these people. If that place existed, they'd all be there.
Why?
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
You can swim?
Not too bad.
We swim.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Where did you lose it?
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
Who the fuck are you?
Yes.
Fire...
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
Why not?
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
You eat first, then you light.  Once you light, it's Yom Kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
Obviously.
Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
It's the truth....
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
A poison...?
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
No.
Yeah, and what are you? A <i>Times</i> man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick?
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
A forty-five.
You're lying.
I can't say that.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
You do it on the inside....
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Fine.
Look, you want cheese, go someplace else.
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
What kids?...
I've got to get back to the --
Who told you that?
A Jewish prayer.
Number ten.
You could do it.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
Why? Why would she?
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
JTS...?
Get out of my way.
I can tell....
I'm a bad shot. I don't think I can --
What are you trying to say?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree?
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
No.
What kind?
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
I think I'll have a coffee.
What was he like, when he was little?
Italy!
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Congratulations, Enzo.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Enzo!
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
Don't.
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
No...
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia! Where...?  God, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
... And his friend, Johana...
... For the mermaids.
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente".  So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
... I'm listening.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
What is it?
Yes.
Thank you, thank you very much!
I can't.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
It's too loud for me.
Lucky I was there to save you.
How do you know that?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
It's me... Johana.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
... Are you sure?
No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
Well... here.
It's my apartment.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
Of course, that's what they're for.
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands.
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
C'mon follow me.
Keep going.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
I forgive you.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you!
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
Worse.
That's some cold shit.
Resting?
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Good looking?
Nice fellow?
I sleep it off.
Let's get in your truck.
Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
That's the place: I remember - My feet were so darn sore, I couldn't make it -- and Galbraith went on up to the head of the canyon by himself --
I saw Teresa. Maybe I was the last to see her except perhaps her Mamacita and her little brother. I was going past --
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Rosita  I have wondered -
When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
I don't mean that. How would he act? What would he do?
No.
It's better you don't know.
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
Thanks, Sheriff.
Offend a reputable citizen and involve the department in a slander suit? No. I'm in office to protect the taxpayers money  not throw it way. Come on, Charlie.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Now look what you've done.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
You. Us.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
We will 
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes majordomo. They are expecting you.
Disney! How inter...
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Excuse me?
You drive a hard bargain.
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
You dont say.
I didnt know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? Ive known for five years. Hes known Ive known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesnt speak about...
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
My husband didnt need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didnt have any. I used a British passport. My names not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
Im sure Ill find a way.
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
What...  Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. Theres a lot of people back there. Theyre holding a seminar. Traffickings the past, breeding the future...
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
And losing you, wed lose him. And that would be a shame, dont you agree?
Have we done business before?
This is a bad line.
Yes... Good, good...
What about an untrained pup, white...
Where is he?
...On holiday?
Finsbury Park. Were in Finsbury Park.
I dont know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I dont know where the kids are... I work for Martin, thats all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
The company. We all work for the company.
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, Ive got to get to...
Got it. Puppies.
Good.
Its not.
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Look, I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Three oclock.
The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
How are you, Rhian?
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My fingers on the trigger, you hear!
Should I be?
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
... No. In fact, Id seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasnt getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Good. You neednt worry about the Austrian anymore. Hes dead. Ill be in touch.
No...
Los Angeles?
Id appreciate it if I could use your phone.
I know his work better than I know him.
What about his girlfriend?
Would you know where I might reach her?
Could that be Camden Market?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr- pubescents.
O est pass ton salon?
Eh bien... Tes sr que tas besoin de moi?  La petite ma lair assez bien foutue, non?
Who?  I dont know who the fuck youre talking about, sunshine.
The acid bath?
If he had, youd be dead.
I can only tell you what he told us...
Dont tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Sure. But speak English, will ya, ha ha...
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
You make it sound so simple...
Tell me...
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
But it is what I want.
But... why... what's the point?
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
Good.
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
I don't remember.  Maybe.
Quite a few.
To avoid killing anyone.
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
We want her burned as a witch!
Well then?  Start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
Am I... am I dead?
And God who allowed you to be caught?
But where are you going to be?
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
In a village called Domremy.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Last night.
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
... You look wonderful...
Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
No doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  They don't fight for causes these days. They fight for money.  Who's going to pay them?
Yes.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
20,000 gold crowns.
He's on the other side of the river.
God.
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
We need another ten minutes...
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
Me too...
No good?  This is a disaster!
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Jeanne, look behind you.
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
No...!
Yes, but...
Why not?  He has good teeth...
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Why not?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
So your memory's coming back?
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
I don't think so.
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
I need to confess again.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
And what does he say to you?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Jeanne, be patient.
Yes.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
Wladek, please.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
Dorota.
Dead.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
Thanks.
It costs.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
They were taking you away.
Hungry.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
If you need help...
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
God forbid!
Watch his hand
It will be very dramatic.
To be deaf?
Like it were a piano?
Well, she was very violent with the gown. She tore off a chunk of lace. if hadn't been there I'd have sworn she'd used her teeth
That is good, yes.
I'll be back.
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
I'd like to make a swap.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
Nothing just yet
I don't want to learn.
No, not words.
Spoken words?
I just want to listen.
It must come.
Hello.
On your piano, that is the swap.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
That's right.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
If that's the way you want it.
You sure he didn't just pocket it?
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
Hackers.
What am I supposed to do?  Call him for cheating better than me?
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
You know anything about him?
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Neither are we.
What do ya mean?
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
He'll show.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
It was too noisy.
How many guys you conned in your life, Henry?
Ain't nothin' gonna make up for Luther, kid.  Revenge is for suckers.  I been griftin' 30 years and never got any.
Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
The wire is ten years outa date.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Raise 500.
If ya win it could make ya, too.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
No.  What's wrong with the front?
You know me.  I'm just like you... It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
All right, when?
Okay, Tootsie.
Well we can't talk in here.  They're having the place painted.
I feel lucky tonight.
He cheats.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Why don't ya then.
You got a system, Carver?
I'm in.
Let me talk to him.
I need more proof, that's all. Anybody can get lucky once.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
Never heard of the place.
Yeh, but I don't know where he is.
He'll never do it.
Sorry.  Don't know a thing.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
He was?
Is that what it means?
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just around the corner.
Another young man.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
Oh, Andy, Andy!
Give it to me.
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
I didn't.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Macaulay.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
Oh, thank heaven.
I've got to see you alone!
Yes.
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
Forgive me.  How are you?
Yes, she would.
Where are you going?
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Not a thing.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
We were looking for this bird.
What'd he think it was to you?
I'm asking you.
No.
I'll have to try to remember.
You mean about that gun?
It's a bargain then.  Anything you want to know?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
Did you go?
Why yes.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
I guess all the suspects are here.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
Go ahead!
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
That's all right.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
Never mind.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
I haven't been a detective for four years.
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.
Hello.... oh, just a minute.  Police department?
Oh he as clever about that.  He called when you were out.  That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
Hello, Mimi.
Well, don't you?
Yes...
They'll want more than your word for that.
That'd be very smart.  That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
If you like 'em like that.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Yes.
Maybe a drink would help you.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Someone get a doctor.
I'll get some towels. 
You did.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
Not with all your money!
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
He was down in the shop.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Sure.
Couple of months anyway.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Oh, they'll come.  I'll have Guild issue the invitations. 
I don't know.
That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
No... no.
Yes.  Nick!
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here.  You don't learn it in a couple of weeks.  I studied it in high school.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
Move!
Ready when you are.
Why'd he come in our camp.
You said he was a deserter.
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
I out rank you, that's why.
Suppose I don't go for that?
What about Jaeger?
Knock it off!
Blow me.
I did it!  I got the box open.
We disappear for awhile.  We disappear, we came back; nobody knows nothing.
And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
...I know.
We leave it.
I got that...sir.
Mine.  Land mine!
I heard it click.
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
Shut up and listen!
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
Just stay down.
They can't shoot us in here.
What does it look like I'm doing?
I feel air.  Probably opens up outside somewhere.  That's where the light comes from.  Couldn't see it with the lanternon.
It's giving.
Jesus, Jaeger.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Yeah.  Well, me too.
You still got a map on you?
Yeah.
Makes two of us.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
Epps.  What if they're not Saudi.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
And then what?
I don't know!
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Somebody has to.
Yeah.
What?
I don't know.
How the hell should I know?
What?
Really?
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
He'll slow down.
Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
I could use some recon photos too.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
What?
It doesn't mean anything.
What!?
This is so weird.  It's happening, but it's not.  It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
It's a container.  Break the seal.
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
It's real.  I'm telling you, it's real.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
You have to go with us, Wes.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
He wants me to come to his quarters.
Don't go.
Don't be so sure.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
It seems I am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time I am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
We're leaving.
We're leaving.
Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
Where is LUH?
I don't feel well.
What?
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
All the insides are gone!
I thought of something.....
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Yes...
Yes...
Where are they?
Thanks.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
You the Bomb Squad?
Thanks.
Where...?
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Would you?
Nothing.
"Punks", huh?
Reilly! He's loaded!
Thank you.
Alex-
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
Maybe she knows your old man.
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
Fuck factor ten.
How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
Yeah, just a nick ...
Ain't that a shit--
It's about this.
I'll do it.
It's detonation cord, for a bomb.
I thought I told you--
I promised her she'd be safe.
Diamonds all over.
Amsterdam?
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
I thought so.
Yes, Baron.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
Just a second.
Um-hum!
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
M'sieu ...
M'sieu Monescu!
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
No--no.
No, thank you.
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Gaston Monescu.
Darling!
Spanish passports?
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Yes.
Yes.
I remember.
Peaches and cream.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
No. What is it? Tell me.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Hair?
Lipstick?
Correct!  Good night.
You would?
Like that?
I know all your tricks.
I know it.
On the night table.
Um-<u>hum</u> ...
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Yes, Gaston?
I don't believe it!
Goodbye.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Well, where is it?
That's right.
The pumps --
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
Hurry, Rose.
I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
I've got you. I won't let go.
Could I speak to you in private?
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
If only it were that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Just some sketches.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
She had beautiful hands.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Sure. If you like.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Just move with me. Don't think.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
He couldn't have.
Get in the boat, Rose.
Right.
I'm so cold.
And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
Just tell us what you can --
You had it the entire time?!
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
I'll join you later.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
We'll save you a place at our table.
Montana?
Where's Lother?
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
I'll say she is!
I could stand some more--
No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
Never eat before the show.
Well, I can't.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
At seven-thirty?
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Sorry.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Sally--!
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
I'll watch for him, sir.
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Are you screwy?
You take some awful chances.
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Get it!
It's a pleasure.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
I'll go with you--
I wouldn't be surprised--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
I should say not.
In New York.
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Back is in New York.
Send that.
June? That's my wife's name.
O.K.! Send that!
No. <U>Knots</U>!
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
Do what--
Somebody's got to do it--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
Good-night, folks.
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
About twelve hundred.
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Why?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
Hey--you! Where you going?
Then why did you run away?
Nice voice.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
Maybe even my destiny.
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
Beauty, ain't he?
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
This brand.
Well... 'bye.
But wait, you don't understand-
Enough?  Never.
Nothing.  Not a thing.  I'm right As the mail.
Better.
I know him.  That's Creek Johnson.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
Sorry, sorry...
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All right, Doc...
All right.  Then what?
I'm your man...  You win again.  Well played, sir. You are on fire.
What?
Good God, you're really-
Wyatt, are you crazy?
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
I know.  Me neither.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
How would you know?
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
I don't know.  I'm all right.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Forget it, Ringo.
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
All right, run 'em off.
Drop his horse.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Fine.  Better.
I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
Sure...
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
- Thank you, M. But this is more than your man can handle.  Are we in agreement?
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers.
I see.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
Chernobyl will look like a campfire.
Take the girl. Leave the handcuffs. We'll drown her at sea.
I'm sorry.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
- We all want what we can't have?
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Is this another one of your games?
Do you?
It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Political considerations?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
Well... If you insist.
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Interesting video tape.
Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
Depends what number you write.
Three. You? Married?
- And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
He was my father's best friend!
It doesn't quite add up.
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Is that Mandarin, or Cantonese?
You leave me no alternative.
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
No -
Check it again. What about the global positioning satellite? Could there be something wrong with the signal?
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
I see you two have met.
My timing always was lousy.
Excellent.
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
You have to leave -
Get more men up there!
I don't know. He's not in the database -
Will the cruise set it off?
We got the same thing.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
What is it, noontime?
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
Will you still get the money from your father?
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Why in the h...
Like a veil has been lifted?
Do you think you won?
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Now how far would further out be?
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
What happened to your hand?
It's healing now.
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
He knows better. Sunny, apologize to Harry.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
I'll be right there.
Strange as it may seem, it might have cleared the waters. Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
Oh. I'm sorry. Gideon, what do you say?
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
What's a toby?
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
He is in his pigeon cage.
You know the man next door is near death.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
What?  What is it?
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
Well sure, look at him.  He's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife.
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Where?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
That's why.  Sid.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Sorry.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Years of Academy training...wasted!!
Look out!!
Woody!  The rocket!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
This isn't flying.  This is falling -- with style!
We're not aiming for the truck!
Pardon me.  I hate to break up the staff meeting, but THEY'RE HERE! Birthday guests at three o'clock!
What's with him?
Everyone, it's Woody!
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
Miss.  G-6.
Did I get my package in the mail?
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
A lunchbox...?!
Wait!  Wait!  I got a better idea! How about we DON'T?!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
He got it, Woody!

What?!
It's busted.
That's right.  Your toys.
Uh-h-h-h...nothing!  Uh, nothing. I'm sure Andy was just a little excited, that's all.  Too much cake and ice cream, I suppose.  It's just a mistake.
There's no mirror.
Excuse me.
Speak when you're spoken to. He likes his women quiet.
He can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
Home is where the heart is.
Is that all?
Go away.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
You're not so old yourself!
Let me in.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Can you move over a wee bit?
Storms?
We're too young.
It's all right, Finn.
Well, I hope it stays that way.
I can't find Manolo.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
Arnie, thank God.
Why are you talking like that?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Arnie, help me.  Doesn't anyone owe us money?
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
I know I made things worse.  I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you.  Something only you can help me with.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
What?
I was just waiting for the right time.
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
I don't know.
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving?  You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
What about legalizing everything? Has anybody talked about that?
Sixteen
Yes.
Yes.
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
I'm third in my class.
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
So does half of San Diego.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Depends on the state.
Medicinal marijuana initiative.  Or am I being cynical?
No --
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
So you pay off our customs officials?
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego.  And we have a deal.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Your new friends.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
We agree.
Javier Rodriguez.
Noriega is a criminal.
Any idea how much?
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
I have money --
Just tell me where she is.
You won't say anything to my parents?
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Right.  Now it's used by somebody from the Juarez Cartel, one of his lieutenants...  Who knows?  Every damn day there's birthday party. At first I thought they must have three hundred children, then I realized they're taunting us.  Three miles away and we can't touch them. Ha, ha, ha.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
Can you not go yourself.
I'd fucking kill you.
Thanks.
What?
Eh-
Shut up.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Easy for you to say.
Too young for what?
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
Now?
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
Nightmare.
Tomorrow afternoon. Usual set-up.
That's your theory?
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
What's wrong, Allison?
What?
No, he didn't make me touch it.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
When are you going to visit him?
You're all hear.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
Four Grand.
Are you serious?
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
you'll need one more hit.
Stick it on my tab.
Such as?
Are you serious?
It's really nice, Tommy. Can we go home now?
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
That's fair enough.
So what's it going to be?
No. Well, yes. I have to admit it: I'm a perfectionist. For me, it's the best or nothing at all. If things go badly, I can't be bothered, but I have a good feeling about this interview. Seems to me like it's gone pretty well. We've touched on a lot of subjects, a lot of things to think about, for all of us.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Plotting our new course.
Raise shields.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
Jim...? Well, we're dressing informally, aren't we?
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Oh, please.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
Go, Sulu.
I'm flattered. Twelve hundred points of interest in Yosemite and you pick me.
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
I don't understand.
Perhaps I have, Captain. Perhaps I have.
Who is it he reminds you of?
We don't have 1.2 hours.
I did not.
I have a half brother.
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
He did have pointed ears.
Is what possible?
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
That's a little vague, Spock -
A "t."
"c."... "k."
It must be all those marsh melons.
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
I'm afraid of nothing.
I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
The ship needs its Captain.

Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
No. You must kill me.
I belong here.
I don't understand..  Reveal yourself to me!
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
You haven't told him?
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
That Dillinger's on to him.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
For sure...
If you think -
It can be arranged...
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Oh, you want to -- hah. I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here. They hate this tower. They'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. And you should hear the way they commune! Sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. No, I don't think you
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
Tanks...coming back. Let's go.
I'm sorry, Tron... he's... he didn't make it.
Probably.
We have to talk.
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
We have to.
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
In the helicopter.
I thought you moved out.
Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?
See, that's the problem with terrorists.  They're really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
Okay.  Here she comes.
That's it.  Get 'im Harry  We'll teach that little puke not to signal.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Yes, sir.
I agree.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
You're damaged goods, lady.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
Yeah, it was wild.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
What'd you do, honey?
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
No.  Doris.
Sure, hon.
You wouldn't believe me.
Did you pork her Harry?
I told the guy---  I told the guy, this isn't even my order.
Dance?
And you've got one.
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my husband.  And you are?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
What is it you need me to do?
I'm married!
I just glances inside.
Wait a minute -
What letter?
Knock wood.
How come?
Ya looked through it?
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
And here we are.
Want some Goobers?
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Is that your real name? Really?
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
What's your favorite color?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
Five.
At the movies?
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
Uh-huh.
You didn't do nothing.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
What?
Why?
You don't know him -
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
Heard that.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
You wanna get unhaunted?
I don't blame you.
Tomorrow.
Ask him if he got the letter.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
Elliot.
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
How 'bout me what?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Look, Dick, I don't -
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
That's about all I ever eat.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Do you still have friends on the force?
I'm your son.
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
Step inside.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Sure was.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
Rock whores.
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.
What can I do?
I'm not wearing a bra.
No.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Yeah, I live here.
Exactly room-mates.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
We have a very advanced program, something very different, requires very skilled people.
Cole, did you or did you not record that message?
Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
And your only goal is...???
Because I'm a good observer.  Because I have a tough mind.
July?!
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
What?
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
It wasn't me before, James.  It's become me now because of...what's happening.  Please untie me.
You're flushed.  And you were moaning. I think you're running a fever.  What are you doing?
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
I'm not going to "do" anything, I promise.  But you need help, James. None of this is what you think it is.
James, why don't we...?
What's the matter with your leg?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
I...I...We need cash, James.
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
In a few weeks, it will have started or it won't.  If there are still baseball games and traffic jams, armed robberies and boring TV shows -- we'll be so happy, we'll be glad to turn ourselves in to the police.
On the walls -- they meant the animals when they said, "We did it."
Airports all look the same.  Maybe it's...  James!  Your moustache!  It's slipping.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
What's that mean?
You do know me.  You helped me once.
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
You really want to know?
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
Then how come she knows what's going on?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
Might be tight.
On your normal mornin', okay, plenty a time, but today, gotta take inta account your Army-of-the-Twelve-Monkeys factor.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
You can't do that yourself?
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Christ no!
All right, old man.  Christ.
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then . . .
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
More or less.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Same back at you.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
You got two years on me.  What's that make me?
Out of here.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
Yep.
Twenty-after-ten.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You believe that?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
I'm taking my car, and I'm taking it now!
It is morning.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
Genuine Draft?
I think I burned my gun hand!
I . . .
John . . .
Sheriff Potter.
Wrong number.
The wind isn't blowing.
I'm just going to my car.
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
You sure you can manage?
I just drove in this morning.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Thank you.
Come here.
Games?
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
You could just leave him.
Yeah.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
How much money has he got?
Stop it.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Don't yell at me!
We're going all the way.  Together.
What about him?
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
He can kill us.  I don't know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
I'm here.
I'll get it.
I'm her husband.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
Accident.
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
Like you don't know.
Because I'm sick and tired of her little games.  Because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. Because I've got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and I would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You're talking like a mad man.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
How do you put a price on murder?
Make it twenty.
Be quiet, boy.  I'm thinking.  It can't be done at the house.  It should be . . .
And tell her what?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
No.
Trouble with the car again?
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Two-hundred dollars . . . that's how I put a price on murder.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
Will you shut up!
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Oh, shit!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done. I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick.  I'm gonna . . .
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Not taking a drive, Sheriff. Heading out of town.
I don't understand what the--
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
No!
But, Senor--
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
What do you want for free?
Who's cursed?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
Give it to me!
Who the hell are you?
Yeah...
An overheated car.
Darrell's a moron.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
How do you know if you've never tried?
About what you said this morning.
I did?
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
He's up at the Look Out.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
So?
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
Open up!
Eh?
Hablar slowly, por favor.  My ingles no es bien.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Do you have to call me that?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I pack up and go somewhere else.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
Thank you.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Come here.
Like you.
I have an idea.
Still playing?
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Is it pretty?
You don't have any money put away, do you?
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
We don't have to kill him.  Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  It was your idea, remember?  I'm doing this for you.  I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
Anywhere?
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
You could give me my gun back.
Can you make it back up?
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
How much?
The ticket is 30.55.
I'm sorry.  It's just ... you know ...
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Wrong number.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Like you helped her, Jake?
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
I said come on!
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
What fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! You call yourself a police...
Four.
What does that mean?
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Megan, do you ever remember me getting sick?
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
He's dealing with a lot of things.  I think he needs to find answers himself.
Jeremy what the hell are you doing?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
You've misunderstood.
I've come to understand that...  An ill advised purchase in the parking lot.
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Are you for real?
Just one--
I'll help you.
Two hundred and seventy.
Get mom.
You're lying.
No.
How did you get together?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
Why?
Where is it?
We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
Thank God.
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
I told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Don't matter, we don't need no whips.  Spring comes an' Skinny don't have them ponies, I'm gonna...
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
Three days. Are you hungry?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
I... I guess not.  I didn't mean I didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. I didn't mean that.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
She back in Kansas?
Alive?
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
A book, huh?  I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
But he was called...
And?
Is... is it... loaded?
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
Like I was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
Huh?
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Huh?
Lookin' at?
He's clear of the horse, Ned. Better get him.
I can't see 'em.
Yeah?
Well, you don't wanna trust me too much. We'll take Ned his share together so you don't figure I run off with it.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
Yeah.
Huh?
Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Fifty yards ain't bad.  Guess we better get along.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
Two.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
Two more hogs got the fever.
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Who said that?
Before I met your maw, God rest her soul, it used to be I was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. Only she made me see the error of my ways an'... I ain't like I was no more.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Yeah?
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
See that scrub oak yonder?
He's blind, for Chri...
How many you killed, Kid?
Plenty of times.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
We'll bury him.
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
He says they were buying It doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, I'm a little rusty. They were there to buy something.
He says he knows his face. He sees it when he closes his eyes.
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
They ruined me tonight.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
Dig.
County. I was in for fraud.
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
Some guy in California. His name is Redfoot.
Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
Just do what I tell you.
I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
This I had to see myself.
Mr. Soze will be most -
A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
We'll see.
I shivved him.
You didn't know.
Who is he?
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Which is shit.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
I know he was good.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
I just want to hear your story.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
What lawyer?
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Convince me. Tell me every last detail. 52    SCENE DELETED                                                              52 53    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                                  53                         + Kovash's room is now filled with people. Jack Baer stands next to DANIEL METZHEISER, a balding man in his forties. Next to him is Doctor Plumber. Across from her is Ridgly Waiters.
Kobayashi.
But Keaton...
But how - wait. You're saying SOZE sent                  t us to kill someone?
He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Abrams...
Yes.
The man's an ambulance chaser ...
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount.  Two Hundred Ten Thousand.  That would mean I keep seventy.
And no one will know the truth.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
What does it mean?
Yes.
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
No.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Yes.
I...yes.
`They lied.'  Indeed!  When did they lie?  And do you know what a lie is?
Hold on a second.
You ruined my life, Mister...Me and my wife...and I am going to ruin yours...  You don't have to go out there to see that girl.  We been going four years.    Four years...my wife's been crying herself to sleep what they, what, what they did to her sister.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
Why is that?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
It was good of you to meet...
No, you did fine.
I.  Yes.  It is.
Negligent.  Yes...it would have been criminal.  But that was not the case.
That's perfectly all right.  I'm kind of rushed.  Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
Why?
Whose side are you arguing ...?  I thought that you wanted to do something.  I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going  to ... I have an interest in the Hospital;  and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid.  You caught 'em.  Now: how many others did they kill?
I understand.
... that's perfectly all right.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Kathy Price.
Still looking.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
Do you want me to go...?
You're talking like a drunk.
I...do you want me to leave?
Who told you that?
And what makes you so tough?
If I don't 'grow up...'
What is that to you...?
Stop pressuring me...
No...no...
Dr. Gruber's not in.
He's not in, Sir.
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
Fuck you.  I got a call today from Sally Doneghy ...
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
No.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I've got to go see Gruber.    What's the best cigars you have?
Read me what she said.
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I don't know.
I don't want a mistrial.
... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
... and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field ... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent ...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
Yes.
In New York?
Yes.
I did.
Thanks, Franky.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Should I?
Yes.
The Big Boy did...?
No. We have ways of digging out knowledge. But it takes longer. He is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. He blames himself for what happened to the woman. And we know little of the background.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
From whom?
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
It's not my line.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
I want to know who you are.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Okay.
Can I see you tomorrow?
No.
No.
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
Honest?
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
They're none of them right.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
We'll take it! Will it fit?
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Too late. I've got my face on.
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Oh, yeah. There.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
To complete my cure.
I need you.
No!
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
You...  ...fell into the Bay.
Why?
This afternoon.
You like it, too.
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
You've nothing to apologize for.
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
What?
Shopping?
Only silence. It's always like this.
Long ago...
Vaguely...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
Yes?! But --
And it's a all real.
You can't.
Let me go.
More than you think.
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Three whole weeks.
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
How?
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Who?
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
You haven't told me everything.
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Where?
How soon can it be altered?
Can we have it by tonight?
Excellent.
Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
Multiple reasons.
Playing?
Why was the floor wet?
The hell you do.
And you're a little fucking reject.
You don't know what you're doing.
What are you talking about?
We've already done this.
That is absolutely not true.
Open the suitcases, unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs.
What does that mean?
Watch the tone fella.
Any time fat boy!
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
What?
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
Don't ever stare him down.
Don't eyeball your kids.
I know...
What happened? Oh my God...
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
I got you.
Yes money. Adam had a five hundred dollar Term Life Insurance Policy.
Don't sweet lip me.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
I'm with Tina. Is she there?
Where is she?
So who's the lucky guy?
She's still working?
Left side.
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Prison Communication Systems.  An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large, exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
I can't.
Nobody knows.
However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? ...Right?
Shut up Boyd.
Yes, you did. Now that is the question! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves. You tell me Fisher. What have we done?
You want to know what you are doing here?! You are love pumping. You are protecting all that is sacred and beautiful and in sync with poetry and sunsets and little newborn babies. You are walking the walk. This is it Fisher, the real stuff. You love this woman. Love is second to nothing. I love you. I love Moore. I love Micheal. This car is full of love, and nothing - absolutely nothing - supersedes love, man. Nothing. We will do what it takes. Whatever it takes.
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
And what happens when you can't?
Israel doesn't have a King.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
What? What's your point?
You said nobody would miss her.
We're not goosed.
Goosed!
I love you.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
We missed the deadline.
I don't think so.
I'm not sure.
I think so.
I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
Sent it.
Yup.
Yes.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
Who else?
He's quiet.
So what do we do?
We're leaving in three hours.
I will.
Well I do.
I'll see you tomorrow...
Hey. It's me.
No. Just like an hour or so.
Okay.
What!
Can we just talk this out?
No.
Micheal, by accident.
The only proof is those bodies.
Move the bodies.
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!
You're not breathing right?
He's your brother.
Just go ahead and say what's on your mind.
I don't hear it.
The wahoo moment?
What?
Did she believe you?
Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
What song?
Oh I know that. How does it go...
Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
That's our plan.
No, the children sleep with me.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
It's a present from my parents.
You'll think you're still at the convent.
No.
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
Evil.
Then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
You must listen to me before you go.
Yes.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
That's it.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Nothing.
That's life. Some people are brought together, others are separated. What can we do, if that's the way it happens?
Where's the dough?
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
Why?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
Why not?
He couldn't get through the door, then?
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
You are forgiven. Goodbye.
When you are, miss.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Oh, you slept well; don't worry.
Today, a good girl.
You mean a nanotech synthetic organism.
I've seen worse.
If you can catch him.
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
Trying to find out where the bomb is. Where the hell have you been?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
What's wrong with Parker?
Talk so I can understand.
Then fix it.
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
I think I understand what you have in mind...
That's not true, Parker.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts.
As a matter of fact, it is.
In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
This is my area of expertise.
You like baseball?
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
Why's that?
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
For Schumann.
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
Gonna be fine.  Gonna be fine, people?  Are we getting there...?
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
What rig?
What are you talking about?
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
All I need is the one day.
I'll be back within the hour.  Now,
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
I'll see you at National.
Who would find out?
Who's gonna tell'em.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
...that's the general idea.
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
<u>Shifty</u>.  Who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
...<u>nothing</u>...

Yeah...what was I talking about...?
I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
...they just hadn't thought it through...
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
Could we have you in here, please...7
Guess what?  We show, and N.S.A. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the Canadian border.  There are no nuclear devices in Albania.  Z'at put us in something of a pickle?  Albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in The Albanian Hinterland.  The F.B.I. and the Border Patrol, And the R.C.M.P. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque Canadian Border.  The Albanian Government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  There is no War.

Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
Who're you working for?
I'm <u>doing</u> my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me doing here.  What <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
I'll play your silly game.
I have.
This ain't the illegal immigrant Nanny.
...you the Press Office?
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
...uh ... No, that's...
And <u>if</u> you never won an Oscar, How'd you like an ambassadorship... 
I'm sure they do.
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
I saw it on TV.
Big mistake.
I got it in the inaugural.  "Thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  Thank you for <u>voting</u>...

I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.

Too Texan.  Go with the stick.  Thanks.  <u>What</u>...? ...does it have to be <u>Albania</u>...We're locked into Albania...why?
You got a guy, doesn't believe the War is... NO NO NO. An American Serviceman... A brave American Serviceman, is Left <u>Behind</u> ...  He is Left Behind.  He is discarded like an Old Shoe...

How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
No, I think..
What about tipping off Yurovich?
They don't know what's going on!
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
Cindy. Having sex with her is like reading the Wall Street Journal 'cept the Journal don't talk back. 'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining romance, nobody trusts anybody anymore, gotta get a blood test in the toilet before you leave a bar together, somebody oughtta invent an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make a fortune. I gotta get to work... Z's today. 
All right, I owe you one Marv.
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself.
Yeah, don't want to be late for my own funeral.
Stay here, I'll see what I can do.
We are?
So you're hot on this stock?
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
Yes...
I remember that deal. You were involved?
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
Yeah aren't you forgetting something Gordon: rule one, capital reserves. This company has $75 million cash in an overfunded pension. That buys us a lot of credibility...  ...and the beauty is you already own close to two percent of this sucker...
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
Maybe you ought to read him Pinocchio. You told me you were going to turn Bluestar around. Not upside down. You used me.
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Oh yes, I remember you.
Break it.
...too perfect...let's not even eat. Let's just watch it and think about it. 
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
...how do you know? You wish...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Jesus, can't make a buck in this market, country's going to hell faster than when that sonofabitch Roosevelt was around... too much cheap money sloshing around the world. The biggest mistake we ever made was letting Nixon get off the gold standard. Putney Drug--you boys might want to have a look at it.
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
Harold, you don't mind strolling around the block a couple hundred times, do you?
You got it, G.G.
He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.
Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away Ollie.
So why are you dating Jonathan?
Ok toots, I will.
Thank you
Thank you
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
They're all human beings
No, he wouldn't.
What do you mean?
A ghost?
Then why did you?
Do you really think so?
Mm-hmm.
What does she look like?
I don't know.  My aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
Who's that?
Um...yes.
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
You know where she is?
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
I don't know.
Of course.
This is...
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
Stop.
She's making this up.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
She's not a psychic.  Just a very enlightened spirit.
What?
...no...no...no...
It's alright.
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
Did I?
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
Don't.
I am, really.
Not the focus.
You are...
We did.
Shhh.
Mmm.
After that.
Is it gone?
Huh?  Absolutely.  Take your time.
No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
Oh, no...
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
A flare?
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Yes.  And he's going to get away with it.
You told me that I was...
I...
In the living room...
But I don't remember.
Not personally.
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Yes.  The ghost.
Who?
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
Get out of my way.
We don't know that for sure.
It's alright.
She can't be here without me.
Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
:Oh, I wish. A woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved. No, they don't think that way.
Then what is he...?
Come.  There is a lot to read
He made that quite clear, yes.
I don't want it.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
When did she die...?
Diedre Mayfair was your mother.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
Wind - I love you with that which is endless within me.  Bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
Anybody got a BP yet...?
He just went out like & light-
Always loved you..
Explain this to me --- violated...?
It's too soon to know.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I LOVE him!
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
I don't know what you are!!!
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
And whose houses do you design...?
It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
God knows, I'm intriguing.
- a witch.
Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
I don't think of us that way - ever.
No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
And I thought I was the mindreader.
Mm-hmm...
I don't know.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Gotcha.
Stop it!
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
You really love this guy...?
I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
Yes it is...
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
Yes - I have had it for years.
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
I think I will pass...
I'm a dentist
No she didn't...
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
I hated being treated like a failure - looked down on - my sister used to do that - I hated it - I should have known, when we got married - in a registry office of course - she wore maroon - I just wanted a white wedding  I think she thought I was a ticket to the good life. I had a good job, prospects. And she was a slut - I didn't know until too late. One day, I came
Nothing could be better...
Open it...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
No thanks - 
CRAP! - I wish I had taken a photo of your face when I gave some to that DETECTIVE - What's wrong ELLEN - you look pale - maybe you have been eating the wrong kind of foods lately - it could be food poisoning?
You killed my friend!
No - I'll have you after
I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
What's this all about?
I think you had better leave
Don't worry about it -
Oh...
Yes - of course.
Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
Yes - one please.
That's crazy talk.
Maybe he got promoted.
Cut it out, before you break something!
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Yeah, whatever.
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Yeah?
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
But that smile.
So you'll think about it?
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest.
Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
Of course we are.
I guess.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Some of them have to be automatics.
That's me.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Hmmm?
Whatever you want.
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this.
Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store!
Most places are, Jimmy.
My room?
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
You want it in writing?
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
The school dumpsters used to overflow to the point where the stench was unbearable. My award winning expos changed all that. The city added an extra weekday trash pick-up.
Christy's a very talented journalist. I see a Pulitzer in her future.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Your article sucked.
I'm trying to help.
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
But you never do.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
He shut down your paper!  You're stuck writing articles about swap meets and raffles and PTA brunches!
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
I'm very aural.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Maybe someday.
That's hard to believe.
You've seen one naked breast, you've seem them all.
I graduated from college. Did great, summa cum laude and all. And I'm about to launch a brand new magazine called "EXPOSED!"  An homage to Miss Julie Conroy of Xenia, Ohio.
You better.
What? Having spring break ruined by will readings?
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
Forget the store. Think big.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Seldom? No kidding?
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
What kind of ideas?
You think we should be more open minded?
He was in a league of his own.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
I... You know... I...
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
And the other girl, Kelly.  Suzie's niece.
Take your time.
He was large?
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
I know one thing he said.  It was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come." I can't forget that.  He said, "No little girl can ever make me come."
Suzie Toller is missing.
Back to the land of grownups.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
Lombardo's settlement?
Why?  You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
You have someplace to be?
Ray, you heard him...
Yeah, maybe, a little.
No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
Suzie Toller's.  And that's the only thing saving your sorry ass.
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
I said he did.
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could meditate.
Yeah, but...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean together?
You notice my new jumper?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Yes.  God, Mom...
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
I won't.
Do it to ourselves?
Stick?
You know what it takes.
Hello.
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
You think that's wise?
That's right.
That's cop bullshit.
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
Hey, Ray.  Guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and Sam's?
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Are you mad at me?
Hi, Sandy.
Funny, I was just thinking you should do the same.  Since I am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  And best of luck in all your future endeavors.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Hey, I tried the board.
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
It's not a guy...
I adjusted it.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Of course not.
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
What is this?  A whole new train?
We'll see.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
You bring the best out in a man.
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
When you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... Come with me, won't you?
Has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  You are in my domain!
Exactly!  You are on foreign soil. You are a representative of the occupying forces.  Or haven't you checked a map lately?!
"Emperor Miguelito...?"
Just get me some horses.
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Yes...?
My step-father's going to tear you apart.
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Say what?
Madmartigan.
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
Are you okay?
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Of course!  I promise!
Where the hell did you come from?
Because she's sick.
I thought you had her!
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
Well what did she say?
Ahhh!
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
That's all I ever wanted!
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
There's nobody here.
Courage, Willow.
He never misses.
Ouch!  Let go of me!
Shut up.
Try the house.
Pretty much.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Oh, he's good.
Maybe.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
Just us.
Don't try me, Johnny!
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
We do not go into your courts.
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
What?
Anything against zippers?
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
There was.
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
You didn't have to...
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
I have committed no sin.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
They are English. They don't understand.
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
If any!
The Wizard - The Wizard - The Great and Powerful Wizard of Oz - Oz - Oz-Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz - Oz!
I don't believe you!
Ohhh!
Are you all right, Dorothy?
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
Catch him, you fool!
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Stop her!
Oh...
...Oh, did that hurt?
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh! Oh!
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
I knew you would!
Yes...!
Look -- it ticks!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Not nobody, not nohow!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Oh, come on.
It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
I think I'll miss you most of all.
Ohhhh --
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
Yes -- that's true.
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Oh --
Here -- here --
Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
Somebody pulled my tail.
What was that?
Yeah. Me?
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Now...
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Hold still - hold still --
It's a whatzis?
Whozat?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
Ohhhhhh!
No, sir!
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
Yes.
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
Ho -- ho --ho
Oh - look out.
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Well, that's you all over.
Now, now, don't fret.
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
It makes you nervous?
You promised us real things -- a real...
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
So who are you?
I did kill us. She thinks were dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Elektra King.
She just upped the stakes. All her chips are on the table now.  And Ms life is part of the bet.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  Hes not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Hes going to insert the plutonium.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
Which is neutral, no doubt.
I cant tell you...  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
Indeed.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  Shes beautiful isnt she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldnt have done it without you.
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
Were alright.
I know.
I think youre one of the bravest people Ive ever met.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
Shush.
Soon shell be everywhere.
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
Oh James.
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Where did you get this?
How high up does this...arms dealing go?
Someone will come.
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
I won't do that.
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.
What is it?  How does it work?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
I think he's going to the john.
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his mangy cat on me.
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
Coward.  Giving up.
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
You're a cold piece of work. You almost got three people killed out there.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
Yes it does.
No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
That's exactly why we need them.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
You've got to relax, baby, you're paranoid.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
Let me.
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
It all happened so fast. Such an unfortunate accident.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
Alright, so I'll get more.
Why you dogging me up?
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
Of course.
You wanna see my politics?
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
... until he found tungsten.
For what purpose?
I wanted to talk to you.
You know, you --
What if they're naughty?
What is it you're failing to get at? Are you interested in me?
I've seen a lot of rings.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Gosh, I hope so.
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
What do you want with him?
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Yes, sir?
I did, sir.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Yes, don't worry.
I promise.
Very....very!
You're incorrigible!
Goodbye, darling!
Surprised!
That's my good boy.
I don't know what you mean, sir.
This is the only library I know of.
Fron kon steen!
Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
Nineteen!  My dear young man... once the human organism has ceased to function, nature has deemed that creature to be dead.
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
You must be Igor.
Why are you talking like that?
I wonder what's got into them?
Just putting up some tea.
What?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Was he any good?
Can you imagine that brain in this body?
All right... elevate me!
You've got it, master.
This guy means business.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
I suppose you're right.  Inga! Prepare a sedative, just in case.
Don't fall for that one.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
... I'm glad that's...
Act casual!
How do you know it was a 'she'?
It's alive!
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Perhaps we'd better leave.
I thought it was wonderful.
I think I'll...carry him.
This is not the finals -- just sing!
Stop -- singing!!!
Are you serious??
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
I know Frederick.
And I have mine.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Do Something!  Stall them!
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
I'm explaining my reasons.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
