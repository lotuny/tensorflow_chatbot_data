twitter provides a great opportunity with every tweet to ask yourself if phrases are pulling their weight in semantic meaning.
‚Ä¶or if phrases and sentences are being expended in order to divert attention away from a lack of justification for whatever's being argued.

lots of domestic terrorists have used bombs as well. (eric robert rudolph, timothy mcveigh.)
are you talking about the logic behind google maps or apple maps?
prediction: 5 minutes on the facts of the bombing and 45 minutes on "islam is peace."
and he called trump a disgrace &amp; international pariah don't forget that tell the whole story
you may be right that many americans would choose against their best interest because they "don't like" the other.

you realize that by using it as a rhetorical device that, almost by definition, means he says it.
he looked great in his two relief appearances. must be a lot of extra adrenaline when it's your 1st big league start.
he hasn't won shit in years (championship wise) and he's literally handed amazing talent

it's ok cause eminem boutta run 2020

donald needs to wake up. hillary knows what america needs...donald has no clue!
"i'm the best at getting audited."
has anyone asked if they're really auditing him?
why are you repeating these angry statements... not the story

i literally went to twitch to check like 5 minutes ago
nice work sir. nice work.

the difference between other audits and yours mr trump is that you're running for president

we welcome you! remember, we're trying to avoid armageddon.
it was a mistake to bring topic to gun control though
her pantsuit distracts us. too bad she doesn't har red hair
he on that powder.
wheres rain. gave up on watering garden. way too dry.
well, that's what he's saying.
hey watch the debate
i know, right? üò≥üò≥üò≥
yaaass girl this part is going to be interesting if no one touches it.
or squarespace
mayyyybe. though i would maybe put money on it being called the "trump suite" instead.
well in that case it's true!
i feel like there's a nixon china trade joke to make
haha i should not laugh but it's so true.
bad news, it stays that way
my head hurts fam
shieeet haha they ain't knowin üòÇüòÇüòÇ
like admitting, "that makes me smart to not pay taxes", like he lives in bed-stuy
it's akin to myspace =&gt; don't invest in social media internet companies
how could they not get the twitter handle ??
that raccoon is on shrooms
they both needa release them lol
blowing himself up and trying to use the water he keep sipping to minimize the fire gulp
love i cant. i will get a heat rash :(
it hasn't worked so maybe instead of throwing $$$at it.
and very against grammarians who are ruining our exclusive private schools for boys!
or maybe like a shitty version of gre vocab flashcards?
like...with that bs
i can't watch anymore. my brains have leaked out my ears
agreed, they have so many other talents they could be using!
it's tchick-ago ok
seems like ruthless is less concern to his voters than comping across as effective/successful.
what does httr mean?
repealed glass-steagall and signed the commodities futures modernization act (derivatives).
tell katiushka to check out ‚Äòs feed
she's every bit as much a 1%-er as trump is. she's just more polite in company. frankly it makes her more dangerous
did you hear him say bigly before?
whomever wins i'm looking for property in uruguay
hilary saying latino instead of hispanic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
u r the creator of ur own reality üåÄ
wasn't that your nickname in high school
*donk donk*
loving you tonight omg
agreed. i've been here for three days and i have the fear. this is not the country i grew up in.
unconstitutional in nyc as implemented prior to 2013.
boom there ya go
i nearly choked when he said that.
either way this country is fucked, we'll sink deeper into debt and the rich will become richer so people will become communist
you are misinformed &amp; so wrong
^ assuming that lawyer isn't another one of your fake personas.
this is how i know you're streaming this on the internet. wait a tic.
there's been tons all night..."biglsy"
i know. only he is delusional enough to think he does
well and receive a gift in exchange to never forget edgar with some wise words he told a lot of us. all the $ that is collected
just saw it on twitter benches cleared and they brawled.
hate to break it to ya babe, but the seasons over
cablevision is also boasting the red channel and i have my tv set to sports mode for the debate.
just hope we are not going to be made aware of it in the future.
he's making his points. secty hrc has done nothing in 30 years.
creeeepy. üòùüòùüòù
trump encourages melania to have unlimited "me time."
i think he means he knows chicago. she does not.
so sorry about your loss sir
you almost cut my ear off when i said your birthday was wednesday... i want an apology.
not only does he know more than the generals but he know more than anyone
"trump: the man who fell to earth."
knowing what is and what isn't constitutional is a pretty good start.
listen to "morning" by him, it's my soul song üò≠
and that‚Äôs why i can‚Äôt go for that
i had to take a break because i was getting a tension headache from clenching my jaw.
its more about law and order than race in his discussions.
soooo...i drive while listening? does that count? lol
same. but that's why we stand with her!
no liberal bias there
me or the ?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
and why is lester letting her talk n talk n talk. i thought they had a limit ??
i don't know and it is driving me fuckin nuts
nope b he looks foolish and woefully unprepared
johnny knockout!
thanks so much
"i think trump should have doubled the xanax." (from nh)
his eyes are getting more pale too. i was surprised how evenly contrast was on his face was for a change at the start.
ian wins best tweet of the night
that is the best idea.
they're very good
lester shut him up. this is so many more than 20 seconds.
that's why the picture of michelle obama and george w went viral this week.
she is on point tonight
she shut him up so quick! mic drop. üé§
he needs a spray bottle full of water for whenever someone interrupts or goes over time.
if he wants to talk about deleting things he needs to check his staff
it's "bigly"
the readiness is all
might be because some idiot spelled it as 'hilary' on the ticket to the debate üò©
yasssss üëèüèæüëèüèæ
nothing to do, compared to the fascist dictators of venezuela, this "man" is a child playing to 'the little house'. üòÇ
trump is the racist as prove by politifact.hillary works with the black community for all of her career.
thanks , i am brilliant
he has literally no answer.
no. i want to remain sober and i'm just so angry so it's not a good mix to add alcohol. so much alcohol as needed
. raise that glass...it's just getting crazier.
and h you were born in , not !
maybe he's really sick. yup, really sick...just sayin
she is smart knowledgable and hard working. he is a charlatan.
he is just an obnoxious, egotistical, holier-than-thou person
so so gross
she is serving it up
and clicking again resulted in my donating twice! yay!
she killed him on everything
look at clinton's arrogant face!!
luckily i had the prying mans lmao
a black cat just walked by twice, so ignore.
why didn't you get george bush jr., sr., clinton, reagan to share their birth certificates?
because trump accused the first black president of not being a citizen and the subject of the debate is racial tension.
jesus!! he's he's...he's..i can't even type
bye loser; volleyball is better than this
. you're right. he's got three-fifths black friends.
that's cool are you excited
the proof is in the pudding.
who knows lol
i'm living for your tweets
all americans are implicitly *biased* - truth. if you don't know this, wake up.
yea its called systemic oppress. we should all be checking our own biases. thats her point.
ugh yeah that‚Äôs an unfortunate truth. somehow forcing someone to admit to facts has become political
hillary worked for obama for 5 years. that says more about what was said in a campaign.
she sure did
i honestly think he believes everything he says. he has no idea if he's lying
gun control is the only plan has. it won't work because criminals will always find a way to get guns!
hillary if you are not a racist, trump if you are, the republican party if you don't care about the election outside of this
oh no fish - what u not gonna do is have me alcohol poisoned...cause imma be drinking allllll night :(
this debate is ridiculous isn't no admission of guilt just like pleading the 5th, trump..
you really need to watch humsafar and his other works to know what i am talking about
leave the door open, pee quickly and run like hell
this is in purpose even the hair is cut and dyed less severe his combover looks like a comb forward
excellent point. cannot stoop to his level.
i aint gonna mess with my mom when she changes the channel unless i wanna die
one has some knowledge and ability and one is a know nothing blow hard. ask your boss which is which
this is the best reality show meltdown since theresa's "prostitution whore" table flip on rhnj!!!
yeah! if u were a down cow you would be happy to see nice people come along, down too long, u die!
fuck lmao. shes gonna uncover all of the secret files this nation is hiding away
send help &amp; citizenship plz
that's what i heard üòÇ
i miss this day and you
but what about a really against judge? what is that?
she rolls in her lips - this is a conversation that she clearly not comfortable.
hit on taxes/birther what about her he emails? he is unfair
'...someone who sits on their bed and weighs 400 pounds...' is he on drugs? nothing he says is related to anything.
ice ice baby!
haha next time i am taking a photo just for you!
your a fucking retard
i hear a ad here.
she really does has a sweet smile, doesn't she
the entire debate - has he been doing it at other events???
it is! margot robbie hosting with the weeknd musical guest!
ah, could be. streamin abc on the apple tv.
but he did build a fabulous country club in west !
yep. i caught that too.
am i mentioned?
union not department
no way you're watching this and saying we'll have the same outcome either way. just no way.
exactly!! they need to their job as a journalist or become the daytime talk show host they are because they fear a fraud.
i was just like no continue donald
maybe that's where his sniffing came from. that might be too cruel.
kdndnnd djndnd omg have you lost your mind üòÇüò©üò©üò©üò©üò©üòÇüòÇ
the fact check was on murder being up. it is. what hillary surrogate bloomberg did is another question.
we need to make a cortland reunion asap
maybe it was ren?! who says it was russia!
he's a racist and wants applause for allowing blacks and muslims into his club?! he's no friend of israel, btw.
it's a tremendous town
dave wearing rene's jeans?
it's driving me nuts!
trump (cont.): we need to figure out the cyber. all the cyber. cyber, we have to do better. i have a son. he's very good with the computers.
lol you the anti-hotep
your average shit gets 2,000 rts this gonna get 10k minimum
whoa branching out, cl. i see you
i almost want to create a list of every group of people he's criticized in this debate alone. essentially everyone who isn't him.
it is horrifying and embarrassing. it's like a bad movie
your talking about what i said and nothing about what he said your the one not listening
hillary scratches nose for third time
chestnuts roasting by the dumpster fire ‚Ä¶
agreed. it's not necessary
you're right, but isn't that the fear? his appeal as an outsider is increased by her cutting him up?
*votes for shmoopy*
i think you know.. mostly i am just ashamed of us all. how the fucking fuck did we get here?
she is the best
like fuck outta here. your local ballot is down the fucking block. there's absentee ballots. and u still chose to do nothing.
lol i thought it was tomorrow i mean tomorrow so we got time to chill before you go üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
you're the best!! üíñ
does the sniff).
thats i.c.e. immigration and customs enforcement. not isis
no they said u had to frisk all people in the area
any link to reasons why? thx!
- there was nothing he cld say without adding 2 his tack of lies!
if any newsmedia in this country is still legit, lead headline tomorrow should just say trump lies
my new favorite tv show produced by - the new
hit on taxes/birther what about her he emails? he is unfair
definitely not.
"a very against police judge." , you and are killing me! please ! !
i hope someone hacks that 10 ur old kid of his that so good with computers. let's see how good he is.
it has more rts than votes
it's a knife set!
is it too late for us to spin this into him being endorsed by the crystal meth lobby?
hang in there...it's almost over...right?
i broke down to and went to wild: rice and bread
how about saying: ‚Äú3 pinocchios!‚Äù
for you. bro
i am right now giving 'lots of thought to nato' i am
his hair is huge...
i have passed annoyed and am now just pissed. can't turn it off, though.
. this we pray.
i‚Äôm thinking of upgrading the corona too‚Ä¶
thank you, it's called status of forces agreement and iraq would not sign so we pulled out to protect our troops
and he's proud of it. ü§ë
the only thing he drops more than f bombs are cyber bombs.
50% claiming the other side is lying, 50% celebs retweeting
i.. it's almost as if... can only women be sick?!
yeah, these are the most satisfying parts of the debate to be sure.
best entrance in a while.
we are gonna have to take the guns dudes it's only a matter of time. y'all have not ain't evolved enough for the responsibility
lester holt: "wait a minute. wait. is that joe biden's music?!"
probs not. i keep losing count when i get distracted by 's blatant stupidity.
ha for sure. it's amazing any candidates lie nowadays. then again narrative wins. sigh.
and enjoy your white supremacist endorsed overlord.
lester holt totally ineffectual at calling out trump on iraq
were you in your suite banging? lmao
meant to reply to u but also we can't forget he said that
you can do better.
nothing to be thrilled about!!! a lying, narcissistic woman should not be leading our country!!!
it actually wasn't supposed to happen lol
i don't know why he hates his/our city and the facts
way better self control than i.
i'm just sick of how wwe is ran
works at fox. tv and radio host.
i'll be home from the 29th until the 3rd i think!!
...said allotted time? like, for example, directtv where you can do that. thanks.
that 'k' is drunk on debates.
he sounds a bit like a confused teenager
(well and i had just gotten done talking to my brother for 45min)
you want vs
certainly what it sounded like.
*don't react, we practiced this hillz, don't react*
should have taken her apart over isis
trumps 10 y/o son is on it
so did me and and
earlier he said "avoiding taxes, etc." makes him smart. just calling hypocrite.
understood. i wish you peace.
it's pretty sad man 2 more nights like this üôÑ
he also just dissed your integrity and reporting. how dare he?
crowd laughter was cherry on top of this implosion
ive got big meat hook hands so stickering blocks/tokens/meeples etc is a pain in the butt
amen, sir. it is actually a tragedy.
racist, former cheese steak enthusiast sean hannity
after this i need a good spanking &amp; 7 hours in a hyperbolic chamber. and i don't even know why!!
ugh he is so stupid like fuck answer the question
dt was right. no one wants to call sean hannity lol
needs another hit of whatever's giving him the sniffles
i will not vote top of ticket. only local stuff. these two are a disgrace.
&amp; my neighborhood is too sketch for me to go out alone at night... need donald trump to and bring back to nyc
ugh i know. i sometimes think americans are not so bright. clearly, otherwise trump wouldn't even have been there. at all
why thank you, my friend! so nice to see your name and face.
doode i saw u walking out and im in that class right now and it keeps flying at us
but how many times have we been wrong???
and he lost an election stop with this sexist bs wishing for another penis in the race.
lets me clear: all your figures are pulled directly out of your asshole
it's a damn shame when you get blocked for freedom of speech
this is what i like to see.
yes but we lose on everything...
i'll be gone after one topic
...not just those at the top, like hillary.
it's in a white neighborhood he is so disillusioned
also can we all pls stop saying hillary is even remotely as much of an "evil" as trump
it feels a lot more like this to us...
i'm with you on this. especially since someone won't supply me with bake and shark üôÑ
come to ice house for the last set.
that's either a trump debate quote or my response when asked 'who ate all the buckeyes?'
trump is kind of being rewarded for having misplaced and stereotypical female attributes like being erratic emotional and wacky
i love mattresses. i own properties in mattress.
trump respects trump. that's it.
i thought 's post was timely &amp; was curious if is still acting obtuse about commonly accepted terms. i found out. üò£
explains why his website went down
but he's not a birther anymore, big league!
problem is trump is a fucking retard that is acting like a 9 year old. a disgrace to this beautiful country of ours!
ugh chanel put me out of my misery when is this over
he's said "the secretary" a lot too.
trump will never be the president of the greatest country in the world. this man said we live in a third world country... lol
hillary supports sharia law, i don't!
what policies?? lol
he's not going anywhere.
stay cool, friend.
same to you. we should play some golf sometime.
"what do you plan for [relevant issue]" "idk but have u seen the size of my ball-- i mean money"
i wouldn't drink a beer with him if he was buying the beer if the gods.

she doesn't have much time. if hillary spent her time defending his insanity, she'd get no points in.
or is this just some clever ad for game of thrones , if so brilliant
every time he interrupts her, every time she politely waits for him to finish his turn, it feels all too familiar.
privitize weld
no, but he likes to pretend he's a patriot. that demands respect for the office--but you're right. too much to ask.
"nuclear war is bad, mmmkay?" - mr. mackey, who already had better hair and less annoying vocal tics than trump
which channel? we haven't seen that.
frowning all way to the bank lmao . his school getting paid
and the hair. that hair.
former kyle barraclough!
. lol you paid money for your trash to show up on my feed
oh dear god his answer to that is even worse. no real amazing witty soundbites, eh
can even imagine? the twitter meltdown following? omg.
unreal. so many bad decisions.
allowed too many inexcusable points like.the long fg and roughing punter. this should.be over
not yet. but there has been enough litigation to indicate that it will be and should be.
i was happy i got triumph and tragedy already stickered lol
thank you :3
lol sean we "put the lid on irans nuclear capability!"
i would like it to be perceived as more of a playful jab at his presidential candidate choice-- from a fanüëçüèª
that's not a secret, he literally said it during the commander in chief forum, but no one picked up on it. so sad. üò¢
just an fyi telling me not to criticize a public official is antithetical to my beliefs and principles. never do that to me.
us young folk are realizing the harm and are not practicing regardless of which religion you were brought up on
we are in the mohawk valley!
thanks babe yours is too ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüåπ
exactly my motivation sometimes
yes because he's filling space with all those words.
hrc have "stamina or look" a prime example of why lester is trying to get trump to just answer the question instead he rants
excellent work. little mac!
lmao i just said the same thing. trying to parent on stage
her husband happy so he went and cheated on the dumb wrinkly bitch makes it even better
stop the hillarity!
i said no such thing!!!
ive gone from "i can't believe im voting for clinton" to "i'm considering donation to clinton's campaign" over the course of this
is it greedy to ask that the mariners lose too??
lol i have to wear mine
idgaf abt his tax returns... i wanna see his twitter analytics.
she handled that loser b
also wants credit for letting blacks drink out of the "normal" fountains at his country club
well one of the parties is at least addressing racism in this country and it isn't your baby hitler.
i miss college
i really wish people were not wasting their time watching this dumb debate featuring 2 idiots.
thank you i appreciate it a lot
if he‚Äôs still interested in politics after this, you have a problem
i'm just impressed he knew what that word meant
throw tomatoes.
tfw you realize this went on for 90 minutes
not a lot of stamina on your period
i low key love your drinking brown likka from a mason jar.
hit on taxes/birther what about her he emails? he was unfair
yup it's hard to moderate a racist bully running for president ü§î
hmm, putting ur opponent down in a presidential debate by mannerism is never a good idea. worse than harsh verbals
i've never read something i've agreed with more.
because didn't give you a chance to.
oh and that bit where he screamed i have a better temperament!!!!
not i if i feel like the conversation is going no where i'll hang up
it was excellent
the soylent
. i guess he needed to save it for his taxes? oh, wait...
she trounced him i think
thank goodness
trump failed hard
i'm happy for this debate, he has no self control, just full of himself
i apoligize.
im suspicious of sample bias
. tom brokaw and mark shields may be merging into one person.
true yeah, but some of them gas station be tryna charge
there were multiple what are you waiting for strikes tonight
what a casa-fucking-nova
hundreds of millions and all of them very not nice, bc women gotta be nice
meet you in district 13
‚Äúoh right, i‚Äôm supposed to do that before the camera cuts.‚Äù
probably because he doesn't know the facts
yup. he's about to go in on twitter
you are correct about that
what event is happening in your photo sukhjit?
listen/support your local public radio &amp; tv to learn what you can do to take bake our country &amp; save us all!
hit the wrong button waaaah
a $5 off coupon..but i'm pissed now bc hooters is closed too and i just wanted some damn hot wings
she sometimes stammered though. still better than trump whose sniffing looked like he caught some of that pneumonia himself
i was laughing so hard like wtf just happened,,,
holt's contribution to hilry - woudnt move off birther so she could avoid economy
they are not troubled by it they have their criminal justice system to deal with that plus where is the correlative things that created it?
agreed... sick of her .
how bout you focus on the presidential debate!
nobody cares what you have to say honey, it over, show some love for your next president
best set i heard on that roof this summer.
from an evidentiary perspective, she fucking crushed it.
thanks event!
well you're lucky she represents you, then.
in conclusion, the rosie o'donnell show should've not been cancelled in 2002.
if you find a captured version of that, pls share!
also, trump exposed all the problems hillary has created and failed to resolve over the years.
do do it! just wear an ankle brace thang n you good üòÇ
i want this on my tombstone
he'd make the dude proud.
lock her up, if nothing else, for spite.
he didn't lose. he knows nothing and said nothing and is a complete blow-hard. but she smirked a lot and is arrogant.
in fairness if you state 10 biggest issues to smear russia, an objective person would find 10 worse things about the us üò≥
great smokesüëç
remember this game? never bet on echo fox
how can you vote for someone who never replies and always avoid questions. she made a mistake and tonight again she admitted it.
spiders are terrifying, this is mildly annoying
i am planning a small dash competition through asp program and from there we might think of hosting a dash competition
i'm guessing 1996 but i was a late bloomer
clint eastwood.
will hilary release 30000 emails for trump tax release ?
i literally called that she would wear a red suit i'm so happy she did.
want to run a 5k??
thank you!!!
you smaht. i can't look away. torn between "we deserve this" and ineffable sadness.
yes lmao second time it's happened to me in 5 days
i think she communicated better
the epitome of fatasses
i'd still buy from you ‚ù§Ô∏è
maybe he's coming down with something. like the bubonic plague?
same. the whole time i'm muttering under my breath a super long w w w h h a t t ~
the champ won. but barely. ;)
and our elections last so long that by this point, the merge feels normal. he was buffoonish, but not enough to disqualify himself.
everytime he had hilary caged up, she would smile to show her cool and it happened very often tinight.
it works for you
i think it's time.
agree 100%!
and i have been to falls.
where's the leather jacket?
i think filled in the blanks when he chose to demonize immigrants as criminals
fortunately you're not his advisor
that shit is beautiful
. so. freaking. awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è
kdk8 and kurt learn to dance
i was so annoyed with not asking one tough question of her.
i agree he could've pushed on the emails issue, but then she ended it by admitting the full fault
haha it's all good! it certainly was awesome acoustic! set: lucky denver mint,big casino,sure &amp; certain, new song&amp;the middle
this wasn't a debate! this was hrc chance 2 attack trump! as colton powell said hrc messes up everything!
not sad. he's slipping on his own shit.
apparently she smiled too much????!!?????
some fucking me shit
agree, i think lester holt held his own as well as anyone could.
oddly enough, someone i work with mentioned this to me today so it's a sign i now must go.
yeah seems to me they saw a very disconnected candidate that sometimes sounded real alongside a stilted, but true politician.
wanted more on her damaging policies!
but at this point i don‚Äôt really see how i can vote any differently than i plan to.
thanks homie! üíï miss you
who knows, really, but i'm kind of (very) upset they aren't playing still breathing. that's my favorite of the three released
yeah like an hour later of me sitting at the bottom of that girls apartment complex in the heat
wrong* fuck i failed
no lol so thats why i am super confused
it's so frustrating!! im really hoping apple increases the storage when they come out with the new macbook pros!
he'd release it before only for those emails
he does have all his tax money to spend on other things....
and no protest votes for national office. that‚Äôs an abdication of your civic duty.
where did hillary get that pants suit chairman mao?
she was pumped with ?
i stay off of fb.i don't want to discuss politics with friends. ltrump is mean, cheating elitist.i lived in dads trump village
shameful. he just doesn't get it. who was he to ask our president for his papers. come on
it would have been amazing. it would have been the best encore song after jos. like when they did brutal love after jos in 2013
i was there in spirit. hope to come home soon!
eithervthatvor he's on coke!
where did hillary get that pants suit chairman mao?
here mfer 0Ô∏è‚É£‚ûñ3Ô∏è‚É£ you cost me money
ahh i keep losing this! i'm saving this and favoriting it forever.
what? you can be over-prepared? what does that mean? see and ? unbelievable.
and will the media fall for it? probably. not you/all in, but the daytime coverage? yep.
lol no, that guy is off the rails, i wouldn't waste my money
either that or he's on coke!
still coolin tho
that hurts, but it's true.
i think you can find that on the interwebz? üòÇ
i couldn't even get in, they gave tickets to only 100 kids out of the whole school üòÇ
because he can't tell the difference.
i agree! likely had to do coke to stay awake and smoked enough weed to make him doze off.
wait did i miss something? romney did well with women? trump will exceed romney margin w women easily.
i did earlier today in preparation for this evening
i love how brags about following the "if you don't have anything nice to say..." rule. that one time.
need something to make it seem like she didn't do well. wouldn't have said if was a man debating.
net neutrality
the reason i know i couldn't be president. i could not have kept my chill up there.
whaaaaat?! didn't think i would hear that from you. to each their own üòò
a very minuscule (yet true) part of his epic fail.
right behind ya!
i heard that. nice new word. it will probably be added to the dictionary.
: he does, but you, lying treasonous hilarity, don't.
we want to hear your opinion! join us on talkshow for a little bit ...debate.
people called in and voted for trump again and again and again!!! they're so excited
i got my vikings scarf ready for the sb run.
gotta gain a few hundred pounds
this is why dems are struggling. a perception gap.
what planet where you watching from?
the only good thing about election night is going to be ‚Äòs tweets
talk of a traitor. no one say that about our country. the world is watching dummy.
if hillary wins i stay here...if trump wins we move. pretty big life change
well, only if there's no !
she had to be prepared with all the bullshit being slung around left and right.
3rd party candidate?
i think he met his expectations
lol now i got someone to move in with üòè
where did hillary get that pants suit chairman mao?
thanks kyle i needed that üëäüèΩ reassurance
and we need to hold on to he notion that we have the best democracy in the world.
just required major version bump and some build tool reorg. and lots of other stuff on my plate :p
they'll go up for sure. he swayed enough of the electorate who want someone else in there to last this long.
gotta do something on the 3rd debate.
and you said nothing as well...
she's a liar though, can you blame him otherwise? you guys are discrediting someone who is in support of you... just saying.
if you are talking about the ny airports he is 100% correct.
the internet will decide that not his spin doctors.
this is interesting bro
what did y'all think?

thanks joe, always ‚ù§Ô∏è a !!
will see how polls pan out; just like many of your trades you will be proven wrong; shorting bonds still?
media whore
hillary definitely had clear, concise points, whereas i just don't think donald trump had the stamina.
what about bridge gate
wowww, gotta blast. it's not safe here. i wonder who it is.
'bigger' is an adjective being used to describe the noun 'issues', so top of the class!

there's a difference between trump's bold-faced whoppers &amp;, sadly, the lies we've grown accustomed to from all politicians.
there are two countries at this point and neither can understand the other

slide her my way
to be fare, it is the clinton news network. (sarcasm).

i'm so glad that didn't get lost on other people. "last little while" for an entire race! wow
that was a good statement
same tbh especially when she was breaking necks while walking through the halls

hillary has all the economic sense of a implant. she creates government jobs. :/
the corporate ties on hillary are pretty imposing. question: who will she really work for?
you're a real person djt!!! hrc is status quo! debate nowadays are for tv ratings only. we want a prez with conviction!
i get it, but stronger argument in 4yrs with scotus off the table. that's the more strategic move
cnn could have worn ear plugs and they would give the to

you should have brought gennifer flower for hillary to remember what bill did to women!
he should never have brought you up. baad move. you are not exactly unbiased.

holt was a disgrace. birther? why will no national tv reporter press hillary on any of her scandals.she got softball questions
they played dirty and labeled bernie as racist and sexist. that's david brock.
web and mobile app expertise here - get quote -
that's really the only thing missing nowadays: a good soundtrack. in 2k16 i changed it to the wrestlers' entrance music.
'cause conversely, said that being president doesn't change who you are.
so hilariously dishonest. you would have said that no matter how she performed. polls clearly show trump won.
hillary is so corrupt and shes a typical politician. sounds great but will change nothing
what did you look at?
i was so delighted by the bob dylan reference early on in that. lots of fun.
it's clear that has changed the participatory nature of elections in the usa. brilliant.
different standards for black americans, or for those of us who identify as black, which the president does.
holt was wrong to press him on bs. holt never pressed her on anything. biased again
if they're off stage they aren't candidates.
i won't say anymore to ruin it for u-just hope u don't find it as painful to watch as i did. u may have another opinion of it.
why not put a moderator in that will press hillary on any of her scandals or failures? the fix is in
sadly true. nevertheless hc is only qualified stable leader.

maybe she should have tried the stuff that caused trump to keep sniffing all night. or she was just bored.
the ignorant ones won't care and that's the scary part. i need to move out of this country.
outreach could have been bettr however civil rights icons like john lewis blatantly lying about bernie's record is unacceptabl

i googled youtube and it's parkinsons

what makes you say that
for real! not like i text anyone lol
on our site üòäüôèüèΩ
to be fair they still admitted she won. but yeah, sorta saw the tap dance coming
