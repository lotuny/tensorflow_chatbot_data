i am reading along with some very good writers at this event this sunday at 7. come say hi!
i will now tell you a story about why it is not always a good idea to send someone a book for blurbing without asking them first.
hillary clinton did not start birtherism. that's an outright falsehood. this was an unfounded right wing conspiracy theory.
by "network news" you refer to media neutrality. by the way, washington post confirmed hillary started obama birtherism.
i hope your namesake continues to stay alive

she's not saying she "didn't consent", but simply that she "wouldn't have" consented.

trump showed some restraint on the dig at his father, but i'm not sure he can hold back all night.
give me a break with those trade deals with china. you are the first one who makes your cheap stuff made in china!!
hillary has dominated the first 15 minutes. trump is out of his league. wow

folks love his bullshit tho
trump keeps literally sniffling. allergies? so sad. someone get him a tissue.
hilary straight roasting donald
trump is wrong about u.s. investments in solar. solyndra losses easily offset by gains.
i'll take that "small loan" lol
fact check don the con
they're both speaking pretty generally.
we out for that wet floor sign
is anyone counting how many times trump says china and mexico tonight?
"i want you to be very happy." has to make it into the movies. every single one.
when isn't talking, i think is watching himself in the video monitors to try to make himself look interested.
this question😂

donald trump does not give me the president vibe.
i don't know if i'll last for another 70 minutes of this. i need a commercial break already.
lester holt: 'anything happen while i was in the bathroom?'
here's a prediction: debate analysts will remark that hillary was too stiff, know-it-all, and smug.
hillary is the soccer mom that wants to be chill with her girls but her 5yr old keeps bugging her and she's about to loose it.
she's the one who counts her years as first lady as part of her "experience"
you don't have to love hillary, but you've gotta give her credit for being prepared tonight.
what do think of this
what is up with this interrupting ?!?!
where'd you get it? i've been trying to get my hands on one for a while now but i haven't gotten any luck :(
hilllary clinton supported tpp before she opposed it. reminds me of senator john kerry.
. channels john kerry on trade: she was for bad trade deals before she was against them.
he's already losing it.
sheesh. the crowd to watch the debate is literally pouring outside of
trump is bullying her on stage right now
at most 80% of students who won tickets to the debate know nothing about politics. it should have been a selection process. utter bs.
especially in the south, and in rural areas where people tend to talk more slowly. clinton is talking about as quickly as you can talk.
on the west side.
settled in for . you've got this, !
where are the fucking cheerleaders?!
just went to hillary and donald's servers. donald's is down. lulz

my heart is beating so hard. watch. we need you to see this.

trump's inescapable problem is that he's an unhinged narcissistic monster. it's showing now.
oh, there's lester!
she isn't, trump is a fucking baby
isis, as we know, was founded in 1967 in wellesley, massachusetts.
would be awesome if lester holt could grow some balls
so are u loaning me the 14 million or no
i have no idea how this is landing with normals, honestly.
now she's hawking her website as a "fact checker" - now that's !
1-2 1-2 ...
hillary's smug passive aggressive thing is really, really unappealing. hasn't anyone told her that?
we still have another hour of this.
i am so scared for november 8th
i don't think i have enough gin for this
what lifestyle resort do you recommend besides hedo. we are not happy with them after many trips
any suggestions for a netflix show?
is it me or is donald a little less orange tonight?
it's not much of a debate if you get to pick and choose who says what and when
like i said before debate, good for opening question/s, then it falls apart. not programmed for follow-up questions.
chained to the wall and watching the debate? pretty sure that's forbidden by the geneva conventions.
green party lit!
"just join the debate by saying more crazy things" erik and i are screaming
trump speaks at a 2nd grade level... how do ppl support this person it blows my mind
learning about american culture i'm scared
there have been 31 interruptions so far...
trump thinks he's being tough... but he's looking like a spoiled bully.
i'm no fan of trump but you are being obtuse if you really think that.
yep. just crashed!!!
no don't bring poor ronnie into this
why does trump keep interrupting? lester where are you?!!!
no don't bring poor ronnie into this
the first thing out of hillary's mouth tonight should have been "donald trump's plan is only going to help people like donald trump"
donald trump may live in his own reality—but we've got his own words right here. check them out:
for the record, this is when i loooooove .
trump called $1m a "small loan". is that what we want from our next president?
true. i miss brian williams?
yo who wants to go the golf course tomorrow to play golf for the rest of their lives with me?
not watching the debate. but watching the people on my twitter watch the debate is both amusing and terrifying.
temp has lost the debate lololololololwrotf as trump has wigged out
seriously. that’s a killer one.
"why not?!!" omg. i howled. crushing her.
we're not old enough 😕
it works very well for the ruling class. . .
has come out swinging - and he is getting very angry very quickly
so should the fed up the interest rates now? i couldn't figure out what the yellen/fed thing was supposed to end up at?
they are the best puppet handlers in the biz
clinton personally lobbied elites for liberalizing trade with china. she bears responsibility here.
donald trump may live in his own reality—but we've got his own words right here. check them out:
trump it's not time to brag about money you idiot
how long til she asks about his tax returns?
trump: "you've been doing this for 30 years"; why are you just thinking about solutions now?
"he's great at being a bully, but it's not going to work." overheard at chapel. …
twitch should stream this debate can you imagine twitch chat during this shit show?
and, i shit you not, donald’s website is down. l o fucking l
hillary's eyes are going off-center. he's getting to her hard.
what do your taxes have to do with emails? deflect, deflect, deflect!
why does trump's tax returns have anything to do with deleted emails?
a clinton economy = more taxes and more spending!
more than once
the dog ate my tax returns
obama didn't pitch the proper tent.
emails. take a shot!!!
people that make things complex most of the time have no idea what they are doing.. 😄
they were told to stay silent! wtf?!
i want to see hillary's speeches.
is lester even part of this debate?
time..anyone???
very clear in the first 2 minutes that donald trump is not prepared.
rt if you agree hillary shouldn't get to play by a different set of rules than you or me:
this has turned into reality tv. this is basically a lhhh reunion
"maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be." -hillary clinton on donald trump
the jose thing really makes you think ya know? had to go on a rant saying i dont hate harper just in case
waiting for the idiot who will compare the donald to caligula. caligula wasn't an idiot. he was cruel but he wasn't stupid.
is this really the best you can do america?
he just rounded 649 to 650 million.
i'm surprised it took us half an hour to get to the emails
just got the photo thanks 🙏🏾 did you send off the letter example that you posted?
verlander didn't pitch tonight, what's up with this?
26 minutes in and he's imploding. fantastic.
what's popping blood
the smirk on hillary's face is disgraceful, she is not fit to be president.
in tonight's main, i'm hoping for a double deletion between trump &amp; clinton..they're both obsolete. give me 2 new candidates.
omg i was living for the barn lib debate tweets
great visuals! you always do amazing work.
watch the under bite. when he's irritated and spinning, it becomes more pronounced. it's tremendous. yuge even.
this is my favorite tweet so far
clinton: maybe trump won't release tax returns because he doesn't want people to know "he's paid nothing."
"that makes me smart" says trump about failing to pay taxes for troops, vets, roads and making america great again.
where your tax return is?? do reply to this question!!
trump and hillary debating is actually so funny when they come at each other 😂
don’t laugh “i’m extremely under leveraged” polls through the roof
me too bro. ovo halloween gang
trump confusing rambling with answering again.
never heard a presidential candidate cite his friends and say braggadocios in the same breath
did donald trump just use the term "braggadocios" in a presidential debate?😳
"a report i just saw," is favorite citation.
melanie plagiarizes michelle, donald plagiarizes joe.
yep, that's wrong, just temp
to be fair, laguardia airport is a dump.
there's like 3 channels broadcasting it, i can't escape 😂
smart dog. here is my strategy.
i think "marble installers" is the nail in the coffin tonight.
clinton: i'm met a lot of people who have been stiffed by you &amp; your business, people you refused to pay when they finished for you.
"if i had a penny for every ridiculous thing trump said, i'd have a small loan of 1 million dollars." - my 11 y/o emmett

i probably lost all of my friends but i dont care.
i thought o'hare was bad until i went to laguardia. an actual shithole
hillary's permanent fixed smug patronising grin not going to help her.
notice how trump hasn't denied any of hillary's allegations regarding his taxes
they got internet here. barely.
"if your main claim to be president is your business, we should talk about that."
he's probably talked a solid 25% more than her
let’s note that trump did not deny not paying people he was contracted to pay
i thought jfk airport was rather nice.
clinton is going hard on the accusations-but i can't tell if it's gaining traction. seems hard to take seriously, with her scandals looming.
yeah but washington politicians have a reputation of being snakes
man, do i need to stick up for the jfk jetblue terminal?
he's never been to seattle, dallas love field, or denver.
serious question.... what's the sh*ttiest airport in the u.s.?
being fiscally conservative is "bad for government". tell me again why we're 20 trillion in federal debt again, hill.
when releases 33k emails she deleted, i'll release my tax returns-
at event, i should've drank more than i did because this debate is making me ill
he's advertising his hotel !!!!
mountain view!! we'll see ya tomorrow night. 😎✊
everyone needs a secret handshake. 👏
if trump performs poorly in a debate, all it does is lower the bar for him to compare his rate of improvement until november.
did he just say that he maybe did not pay someone because they did a bad job?
has trump even been to a third world country...?
this could get ugly fast!
due to high demand, 2,000 more limited r250 have just been released!!available now here 🙌🏾
donald trump is literally just yelling like an abusive drunken wife beater.
i bet he took pulls of henny before this debate
it's so wild that his clock runs all while not saying anything at all. he's a walking, talking, "2,000-word-minimum" essay.
trump is talking race so i'm going to pour another glass of wine thank you so much
"trumped up trickled down economics" will that be the sound bite that everyone remembers?
i'm not watching but you nailed it on the head! umm, is canada still in the running? we have the room for you all :)
hearing reports that donald trump tweets are actually being deleted during this debate
what it would look like if tonight's debate were reenacted by birds. she's the hawk (super smart); he's the jay (in…
he was in the cwc and pretty much had one of the best matches of it. plus he was on last week.
i can't stop staring at his mouth. why does it look so weird?
that doesn't look like a 7gb patch...
like you don't help any of this shit out. i don't treat her like shit. i know i don't. think what you want
hillary: race is a significant challenge in our country. we have a lot of work to do. lester: mr trump you have 2 minutes. trump: i'm black.
oh oh here we go
hillary clinton: "fact-checkers, get to work"
it is silent in for the first time all night while clinton is taking about race. you can feel the anxiety and hope here.
trump is rambling; when hillary answers slowly, it conveys steadiness. good for her, bad look for trump.
this election cycle has been one slow, painful sob into my whiskey glass as i gradually steel myself to vote for clinton.
hillary bouncing back. hope it stays.
and lester doesn't seem to care... rt : 🔥🔥🔥
hillary clinton does not have the stamina but youve been sucking on water since the 15 minute mark donald trump talk to me
we interrupt the debate for a weather stat: just 6 of 26 sept days have had measurable rain. rain likely each of th…
when baby orange hitler says "law and order", i hear "brownshirts" and "kkk".
when you shave your face for the first time in four years and never let anyone see it
"take advantage of the laws of the nation." holy moly.
it's not race - it's systemic and institutional racism. too bad that neither candidate can actually say the word out loud.
trump's website is down. should've used clinton's server.
er... there's probably a "presidential suite"? maybe? eh?
from now on, i'll use these in budget testimony. the epf is tremendous and unbelievable.
oh yes, let's elect nixon again, it went so well the first time!!!
hillary: "we have to respect the law." not including me of course.
it's almost october and 105 degrees out. i may have made a terrible, terrible mistake.
ay i was like oh yea
sike you the finest nigga out
trump, "taking advantage of the laws of the nation" sounds horrible…
we invested in one solar company...
hey - is still on tv
i've stopped paying attention to the debates. here's something a friend of mine drew in, like, 1990 that i found at…
donald trump: i will release my taxes when clinton releases her deleted emails
is he coming unglued at the seams
soak in warm water with epsom salt :^)
if i were a minority, i'd be asking "why should i bet on a third term of liberal, welfare policies?"
it's the very against police judges that are ruining this country!
brushed up on his ap gov flash cards to learn some lingo in advance of
i can't believe trump is promoting stop-and-frisk in a debate. hillary, if you don't eat him for this, i will be disappointed…
what does this have to do with racial issues????????
braun; nia; bo; bayley; ceasro &amp; shemaus... god that's too much of squash matches
talk about how you're going to solve chicago violence again
interesting that he doesn't try to sugar coat at all his ruthlessness as a businessman, but revels in it.
.....the redskins logo 🙄🙃
hillary: "my husband did a pretty good job." bill signed deregulation of wall street into law, which caused the 2008 meltdown.
these people?!?!? this dude is out if his mind!
not a joke but take note that when asked about not paying thousands of employees, trump bragged about how much money he's made.
"a very against police judge" reinventing the english language before our eyes.
liam is on my lap and we feel the same way about this.
hillary with the notes on deck!
i feel there's so much more out there in this world for me to discover and i'm stuck in my same routine everyday and it sucks ass
"a very against police judge"
haven't you seen that show? it solves all the problems.
"it's terrible what's happening in chicago. i have property there."-
i don't know but people are fucking morons
stop and frisk is unconditional.
her answer is mediocre at best. not surprising. a condemnation of private prisons would be too much to ask.
trump says we need more " stop and fisk" to fix racial divide.
just realized that this election is the best thing to happen to the communist revolution
the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non-competitive.
if your lawyer is telling you not to release your tax returns that tells me you are definitely hiding something.
note clinton's lack of rebuttal on the constitutionality of stop &amp; frisk.
and said a "very against police judge" who put an end to stop &amp; frisk. what? it's both incorrect and bad grammar
he never had them, you can see why
there's a lot of things going on right now, but this loss is still heavy on my heart.. i wanted to find a way every…
what happened? i haven't switched games. pretty entranced by this one.
on a real note...lets go yanks
hillary's red mao get-up really pops in hd though.
is law &amp; order &amp; tremendous a new series i'm not aware of?
was trump's debate prep a bindle?
remember when trump said that hillary’s happiness was very important to him? remember? that was super weird.
i literally think trump has never had to listen to a woman for this long in his life.
those bullets could go through somebody and hit one of my buildings!
i have to admit to everyone, sitting here and seeing fernandez pitching for the is very emotional, and eerie.
t minus 2 hours 20 min
. tells stop and frisk was ruled unconstitutional in ny and trump says "no, you're wrong"
he's sniffing more than bowie on cavett in '74.
for you. you're already on her side.
i honestly love it so much it's on repeat 24/7
stop and frisk opened for hall and oates at the greek theater last week.
lol i was like someone has to he talking about this. this is nuts!
trump seems a little ...flustered, while discussing race in america.
ok so a question regarding audiobooks: can you multitask while listening? and if so, is there a limit on what kind of tasks you can perform?
she is much better than i. i would match whatever depth of low he wants to fight at.
who won round 2 of the debate? our experts weigh in and render their verdicts:
i'll hit you up tomorrow
this is the simple fact about : she is a typical politician - all talk, no action.
i'm not joking. how can any educated person vote for this guy?
i'm hearing is nailing it. is that your opinion? sounds like a reunion where u keep it movin' &amp; gotta stay tight.
do you remember the guy who was like "i like sweaty men"
we love don't we?
"trump is being real about his views and solutions, hillary is just saying the usual political stuff that solves nothing" (from fl)
the room i'm in agrees that trump is getting progressively more orange as this goes on
debate rules: no loose seals, leave a note, there's always money in the banana stand. wait - i thought steve holt was moderating.
i really wish they would silence opponents' mics when the other debater is talking.
i am an iced capp enthusiast
who are these people exactly donald?
mondale sent nancy reagan an apology note for making reagan's age an issue after a debate. civility everywhere has disappeared
you guys. she's simply brilliant.
that was the greatest clap back i have ever witnessed
this is the most pointless tweet i've ever sent, but boy, lester's really holding it down. 🙄
as if deleted emails are equivalent to tax returns. trump is such a disgrace.
oh my god, his language. "they talk good around election times."
. but, importantly, they don't fall!
"hillary" spelled with one l is currently trending 🙄
hillary should've responded "your hands are also under leveraged, and you know what they say about guys with under…
well i'm glad you're here! sorry you're seeing the worst of our culture so early on.
she playing them for votes.she hates blacks
come on alan. you're smarter than that. who's using facts and who's using bs?
holt just called him out for continuing birther-ism after obama released the certificate
sjiildnt play drinking game with trump
reporting in from harlem with a nice cabernet sauvignon &amp; jazz in the background of this shit show.
president obama was born in the united states. he’s american. trump only has one reason for refusing to admit it.
someone get trump a decongestant stat. the sniffing is totally annoying.
. has used a number of moments that seemed to have sprung from her debate prep.
did he just roll his eyes at her?? what is he 15???? that's not my president... i am with hillary clinton!!!! you should be too!!!!
that was gross.
just got handled by ! "i prepared to be ."
ok, cool also incredible work on cheering you all on from sf 👋
hrc killed on trump's refusal to release tax returns. then she hit him for "stiffing" his suppliers. a powerful 1-2 combo.
watch the "undecided" line when hillary talks vs. when trump talks. trump is really winning tonight.
nah no worries i put it in a bad spot lmao
did trump just say that he did obama a favor helping race relations? or is my simulation glitching again?
why didn't you get george bush jr., sr., clinton, reagan to share their birth certificates?
why are we talking about obama's birth certificate?!?
trump: "i think i have developed a really good relationship with the african american people." bish where???
why do these candidates look like killers from the purg- please don't kick me out the us
four is kind of generous tbh. you are too optimistic
manchester i'm pit j, birmingham i don't have tickets yet &amp; glasgow i'm lower level sec 213 row d (r…
trump to date has produced no certificate proving he wasn't born a total douchebag. many people saying, i'm told.
why they unfollow you
who knew i'd have this much fun live tweeting something that's not an award show
hillary is basically saying that all americans are "implicitly racist." that's offensive and is going to hurt her.
hillary is basically saying that all americans are "implicitly racist." that's offensive and is going to hurt her.
no, don't encourage it! he's supposed to be impartial. if he interferes a lot, the debate will seem tilted in clinton's favor.
no one was caring about birtherism because it wasn't true!
oop! hillary clinton coming with receipts tonight
i feel like the sniff is like a tell? like he sniffs right before he tells a huge lie.
trumps law and order and community relations message is way more coherent than hillary's gun control message.
just got out of lab. who's winning?
drinking game: take a drink every time you roll your eyes at something says... see if you're still conscious by the end
don't miss the first 2016 presidential debate! here's how to watch:
not a great logic!! multiple indian young actors way less hyped than fawad, who to me, is at most average
are there no commercials?!
well he will only use his gold plated spray tan booth, and it wouldn't fit in the plane
yes, but the anti-trump campaign can't let getting the facts wrong go beyond trump himself.
smh turn it off
so you're telling me that this is the best we got america? 2 bullshit artists that are not going to change a thing.
wait is he talking about? like: literally what is he talking about?
not funny, a down cow is a big deal
watch her come outta no where and steal the mic like kanye 😂
one of the two candidates for the most powerful job on earth can barely complete a coherent sentence. how did we get here?
did trump almost just say that he was endorsed by isis?!
me waiting for trump to say something intelligent
"i prepared for being president and i think that's a good thing." mic drop.
actually did say that and when she said it he shook his head no. when talks about admiral endorsements,
now it's cyber security &amp; putin. but what strikes me is her vitality. she is not wallowing in physical weakness. she's tough. here he comes
for a second i thought trump said he was endorsed by isis, and i did not even blink an eye.
"endorsed by ice" oh, that'll endear trump to milliions i'm sure
haha and you just happened to be people watching and put two and two together and came up with five lol
hillary can't handle this debate. he is eating her up.
“as far as the cyber…”
ok i'm watching the debate and oh boy am i enjoying every face hillary makes
he's been doing it for a while!
i really hope snl is new this weekend.
are you watching a live stream? maybe your stream lagged behind and was jerked forward.
things trump has not denied: paying no taxes stiffing contractors racist corporate policy
i hear weightism!!!
really useful contrast in real-time
donald trump was endorsed by the customs department? what?
thank you!!!!!
tonight is the ultimate test of whether journalists want to be journalists or blow hard entertainers who talk about expectations.
that slip up was awful
"trump, stop sucking putin's crooked dick." - my wife
how much banter am i gonna hold from you two? just so i can figure out how long to block you for
cherry picking stats is fun. 500k increase in stops from 2003 to 2011 brought in 176 additional guns.
got damn right
i have a daughter who's two and so good with computers. and i wouldn't want her to have a president who looks down on women
good hit by trump on debbie wasserman schultz.
guys you gotta hand it to trump, he didn't discriminate when he built an apartment in a town that is 96% white
. is the drunkest human in america right now --&gt;
why is donald sniffing so much?
donald trump: our cyber is the best. the best. it's so cyber. so cyber. the best. in regards to the cyber, it could also be a 400-pound man.
brb, going to take a nap for the next four years
that silly squidward/wayne meme
i have a son. he is so good with computers it's unbelievable.
i just said the same thing!!
i genuinely feel like i'm watching bad tv, not a "presidential" debate. alarming.
are you even listening? lol. he won this debate easily. you literally have no clue what your talking about lol.
hillary scratches nose for second time
this debate.
i just get very frustrated with trump's constant commentary during clinton's 2 minutes. they should really just tur…
harry, cmon. people ought to start calling her the surgeon. she's so sharp. she's slicing and dicing him.
as someone who was co-president of an anime club, i can confirm
thoughts so far?
getting all emotional. so proud of our hrc. she's is doing amazing.
nothing gets me more tight than when i talk about this election with someone and when i ask them if they voted they say "oh no i didn't bc-"
love you bro❤️
everyone go follow my crazy talented and creative best friend
listening to talk about isis - note deep inhalation and nose rub (of course,
i know i'm not the only one who heard trump catch himself by saying " i'm endorsed by is- "
politico wrongometer: is wrong: ‘stop and frisk’ was ruled unconstitutional
if there's any justice, history will be unkind to &amp; for their shameful opposition to peace in colombia
holt: re birtherism: "what do u say to african-american community?" trump: "i say nothing....i did country &amp; president a great service." oy.
this fact-checking is on it
trump's favorite tv shows: law &amp; order and my 600-lb life
.: "we should've taken the oil."
nato being the "longest military alliance in the history of the world" cannot be true, hillary.
"a very against police judge." a presidential candidate just used that phrase. he has great words.
could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds...
check out 's tweet:
tonight i learned if you say "wrong" into a microphone three times, you win a debate.
yes ice. lord help us.
man i want yo say something funny but this ain't funny man. this shit is not funny at all.
tfw you want to stress eat all the garlic knots because of
ok, hillary has got to stop outsourcing fact checking! just say "you cant take the oil: its in the ground"
good work bro :))
good news: if you elect trump, you also get his 10 year old kid. he can handle the cyber.
his hair is crazy... just crazy
you are on a roll in twitter today! i am loving this debate and the total lack of focus by one debater!
hopefully, when you're there, your colleagues would be of equal merit.
after a brief poll of the internet, i've settled on gin.
true! about why we had to leave iraq. our troops would have been in serious danger
it always comes down to money with this man. it's all he knows.
donald would solve cyber by appointing craig wright to uscybercom
my twitter: 50% debate analysis and recap 50% people giggling about the word cyber
where's all the white male pundit concern about donald trump's health? with this crazy sniffle? hmmmmm?
i feel like he has spent a lot of time this debate explaining old crazy shit he did or said while she is just calming blinking at it all
perkins has a character select screen! sold!
when people say isn't going after americans' guns...
i hope joe biden shows up like a wrestler coming back from an injury.
you think we may be able to know before eod?
fair enough. i agree it is still up. the fact that he contradicts so often is just striking, yeah?
dummy lol. democrats were main people in the kkk and fought against freeing the slaves..be proud of that.
lester holt, war monger: "who's behind it? how do we fight it?"
donald trump: "i have common sense" me: *donald trump voice* "wrong"
"i have investments in charlotte"
he should blow his nose. he’s already blown the debate.
i am thrilled to see a woman in a general election presidential debate. my mother thrilled 😆
wanna know what shouldn't have happened, trump? you tryna become president!
odd how wrong trump is about crime in the city he lives in. declined, so did murders. cc…
how does hillary not laugh at some of the stupid stuff donald trump is saying?
it's cool you acknowledged that &amp; deleted thanks
who is sean hannidy?
how long are you home for?
...most of the time they go over their allotted time and they get cut out abruptly near the end. is there a way to record over..
somebody call sean hannity and see if he's okay!
i mean, i don't love when he talks ever. but those times are less bad
nothing could sum up my feelings on all this better
charlotte vs. sasha again
did the audience just laugh at trump saying "i have a better temperament" ?
oh my god hillary just stared straight ahead the entire time, into the soul of america, pleading us to be intelligent
watch the "undecided" line when hillary talks vs. when trump talks. trump is really winning tonight.
okay but seriously guys all joking aside: when are we going to get serious about cyber
i swear i just heard donald say "i was endorsed by isis". he also said "very very" and "beautiful" and "i" a lot.
but when trouble cones in their backyard they expect us to foot the bill. they agreed to the alliance they should be all in.
like many, i was willing to listen. i will go checkout his website, i guess.
lmao man i been laughing every since i tuned in
clinton said trump’s birtherism was part of “a long record” of “racist behavior.” he called her “holier than thou.”
"i have much better temperament than her." this just crossed the line into high comedy.
stickering doesn't bother me. i get into a rhythm and enjoy it. although it's redundant, it's not too bad. can't wait to play!
we should ashamed that this man has been allowed to get this close to the white house. not a coherent policy. not a coherent thought.
yeah, let's go talk to that totally objective and non-partisan paragon of journalistic integrity, sean hannity.
thank god there's only 9 minutes left. trump has just lied the whole time.
he's terrible
"call sean hannity" is his only defense here. and its new. we just started hearing that claim more this past few weeks.
hello!!! why are you allowing him to ramble?! wake up!!
neither candidate is a good choice.
my beer is already all gone how did this happen
the thing that scares me is i felt that way watching george w debate. and look what happened. twice. 😫🇱🇷
m2w2: shannon weber director ; leader by providing education &amp; resources 4
i'm gonna fuckin kms this flying insect just attacked me in class in front of everyone im so embarrassed
this is just...this is...something.
this foreign policy debate would be way different with bernie on the right side of
let's be clear: most of hillary foundation donors are muslims!
randy savage chants?!!??!??
hey i think hillary is to politicians as the star of texas is to stock shows.
we should have taken the oil! would have needed a few large jugs, i guess.
alcohol poisoning
. takes 1st jab smarter, harder working &amp; more honest than &amp;…
a club that didn't just allow white people to join???? heroic.
if you're seriously voting trump please never speak to me again
hillary while donald is talking about her bad "temperament"
this is sounding like i should take the next flight out to trinidad lol
it's a ghost town in streets of
i don't know, maybe, probably, essentially, totally, yeeeaaahhh.
hillary is getting knocked for having "male" attributes of being stoic and shrewd and intelligent and manipulative
all the heavy mattress hitters have gone to mexico and who is defending the mattresses in japan
this debate's painful to watch, donald not making any sense &amp; hillary clearly lying, we need to get in there
although the entire world is considered to have consented to neoliberalism, it doesn't make it inevitable.
uh oh. just fatshamed hackers
.: barack obama is your president too.
someone should buzz lester and let him know he can challenge hillary like he has trump.
the inner cities. the african americans. 😂😂
and hillary manages to call her donald every time.
being realistic here, if trump becomes president he's gonna get assasinated, and hillary is fucking stupid so it's a lose-lose situation
add your name now to join the millions of americans who are with hillary all the way to the white house!
he hasn't said any of his policies
new star adman for
not global warming, says the man that didn't just have a 100 degree day in los angeles the end of september.
haha hey buddy. hope all is well.
its a mess he isnt even answering wuestions
trying to think what it would take to get me to hang out with trump. you know, at a bar, just chatting over a beer or two.
hillary empty rhetoric😡take out isis?🙄ur 2 busy wanting these ppl 2 enter🇺🇸without vetting👎🏻…
clinton keeps asking the fact checkers to do her job. why isn't she calling trump out more?
what the hell is this cable hack message on tv screen smh wow lol how do they do it , this is cray cray !
as a woman, this feels so personal b/c i've felt this sort condescension from men before.
gary johnson and william weld are looking pretty good to me right now. :-)
oh, amy, you expect civility &amp; respect from him? 😉
trump: "as far as the nuclear is concerned--i agree..." (whew! was worried there for a sec...)
second time the captions have said “anna nicole smith.”
he has too much education to act that way. his alma mater is probably frowning
trump's biggest liability in this debate isn't that his ideas are bonkers; it's that he can't speak in complete, coherent sentences.
can't think of a tougher name in baseball than barraclough.
. to : "no wonder you've been fighting isis your entire adult life."
"the only secret is he has no plan" is a really weak line
would literally chop of a limb to see that
she's actually supporting that disastrous iran deal.
un freaking believable.
weight is not a protected class. give it up
yea, i can see that being a pain. i pull 6 stickers off at a time, stuck on my fingers and jam them out quick.
i'm real glad i helped you out some but cheer up things always get better :)
see you on tv tonight
ah, the old liberal blanket statement: people on the right are not intelligent.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥the only secret is that he has no plan🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
we know she's not perfect but at least she's not a racist, misogynistic ass who wants nuclear codes.criticize after she wins
are really just in human nature... religion for the most part seems to be really hypocritical, illogical, and leaves too many questions.
where upstate?
your avi is gorgeous
ya!!! sometimes i get into a tizzy and i'm like what have i done the past week and feel this need to keep a record
obviously i live in something of vacuum/echo chamber of well-educated urban fags and all, but does anyone think trump is doing well tonight?
lester holt seems to be cross-examining trump, but not doing the same with hillary...
&gt; on "stamina"
"it's not nice!" trump talks like he's six years old.
in benghazi and the fact she wants to focus on trumps taxes and not actual country issues
hillary rolls around in the mud.
hold on... are you saying trump doesn't lie?!?!
clinton has done a good job tonight. anyone who says otherwise is a bald faced liar
blue jays lose, tigers lose. orioles are now one game back of the wild card, and have a two game lead for the wild card.
//can't fucking read without my glasses shit
he’s gonna tweet a lot of things.
hillary so flustered she plugging her book..
paralipsis ftw!! he was gonna be a jerk but decided not to -- what a gentleman.
good i believe that also..but the part about what party is racist..brainwashed
as soon as the debate ended someone popped a champagne bottle next door lmao
oh look, a toxic twitter tl. saw that one coming a million miles away.
i'm sure you'll be ready soon and you'll do a great job
i'm only watching this tripe because my son wanted to see it for his constitutional studies at school.
trump couldn't even make it through this debate! stamina my ass
wait, the next debate is in vegas? in my city!?? i'll be there!!
“this is not a nice thing”
trump talked way too much about his feelings he must be on his period
decided to watch ; i have bourbon though.
will be on next to share my reaction to tonight's .
i think we've been hard on that was a tough job! maybe he remained too calm. but one must remember trump makes it hard
um, to bug him?
as long as alleys stays open idec who becomes president
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
our view: clinton came out ahead after first third due to trump taking up time reacting to her criticism making him defensive.
almost every girl
that teixeira stare and bat flip why did no one tell me about it
not sure which is more grody.
huge applause when trump says he is winning without spending anywhere near the same money on ads!
clinton wasn’t great. but she was definitely better than trump.
enzo and cass!
what you missed at the trump-clinton debate
. proved once again tonight: he’s a thin-skinned bully who doesn’t care about anyone but himself.
km sitting here in canada wondering the same thing
are you watching
brokaw: "and she was pleasant throughout"
air is free period , it's the law here. she was just hella hating on me since the moment i walked in 🙄🙄
duda took that strike as though he was totally guessing, and didnt see that pitch out of the hand anyway. very hittable. backwards k.
hey babe lets spice things up tonight and watch fox new's recap of the living nightmare that just aired.
"hundreds of millions of ads"
excited for my grandkids to ask if i voted for trump and then i'll say no and feel good about myself.
daaang, trump was not gonna shake his hand. but clinton was like 'wassap?!' hand shake!
slightly surprised no mention of benghazi from trump.
if you don't believe lost look at his body language &amp; that of his family after the debate. the clinton's are greeting crowd
i don't think a politician has ever once made their point within the debate time limit
yay! isn't just for shoots and parties, you can host meet ups here too. great c…
i don't care for either candidate 😫 what do we do???
who do you feel had the best tonight? (note: non-scientific poll)
they told the seamless woman they didnt have any drivers so my food has just been sitting there....ok....so she refunded me and gave me
one thing she got right was not to get too much hyperbolic over trump's ridiculous reactions
"i was gunna say something horrible, i really wanted to, but i'm a nice guy"
who cares about 's birth certificate? who cares? terrorism, immigration, economy.
tom brokaw said people troubled by black on black crime lmao who he talking about? white people!!!
here comes helping hillary. can't stand her.
didn't invite the mother of my child to a baby shower you all were trying to throw for me ‼️? you all must have lost your damn minds ,,,🙋🏿
clinton helped lead the charge into libya + iraq. trump supported the iraq war. neither has the judgment.
rsvp: for free entry before 3pm and reduced admission after.
oh fuck all y'all. i did this for a living for 20 years. i argued on the record with middle-aged white men. she crushed it.
btw, looks like punk took event's advice and haven't been on
i am a woman who will never vote for hillary clinton. she doesn't represent me.
who woudlve thought rosie odonnell would be mentioned in a presidential debate?
trump family pow-wow in the back of the stage while the clinton family greets the crowd -- amazing image.
what? other way around
i'm so tempted to ball tonight but so nervous on how my ankle will hold up. i miss it :(
sry for me snap but i'm snap but i'm not have a good one
i've never in my lifetime seen babbling incoherence on a presidential debate stage like trump is displaying tonight. i'm in a nightmare.
i need a long shower.
does anyone out there think trump won that? serious q
curious that under no circumstances does trump criticize russia. everyone else gets smeared without hesitation. non-disparagement clause?
about last night
echofox how exactly do you drop a map to muffin lightning.
she was very good, so prepared and actually funny. he was incompetent, never replied to questions asked and sniffing no stop.
oh, it's over? is it over? everyone register to vote! please vote! this is terrifying!! we are terrified!
you are on!
let me tell you of the age of aol
donald should go take a nap, he looked so frazzled and exhausted – does anyone have a chair with a pillow maybe?
trump on birther issue: 'i think i did a good job'
i love her red suit. shark is out.
i have so much i have the best stamina. i have the best experience with stamina.
thank you tribe!!!!!! the pounding sound you hear is not my drum. it is my heart beating. go tribe.
in the spirit of "fuck everything," i'm ignoring the tv and alla y'all right now and eating a giant luscious ball of burrata.
lemme guess you got it at occ i had a flat there today 😒
neither won and we all lost.
eating in the mcdonald's drive thru while waiting for our 40 peice mcnugget 😂
so my chocolate bars melted and i put them in the freezer and now they're ugly what the...
notice trump sniffing all the time. coke user?
somebody that sits on their bed and weighs 400 lbs. what?????
i'm thinking the champ won, no?
our politics were already somewhat absurd but to have it merge the style of reality television is just too much.
trump started well with creating jobs and then just lost the plot afterwards
☺️☺️☺️ it's the eyes
i recently took action on this thought that i used to often have as well, highly recommend 10/10
do you agree with 's comment on ?
well, i'm happy that you found a candidate that represents you!
john elliott x gap gq collection available now!! early links!!
interesting note for tonight’s debate, there was not one question about immigration.
by the way, there's a much more solid version of a trump argument against clinton on iraq if he just stopped insisting he was a visionary
doing some epic color coding to keep track of character arcs! 📚
when donald trump says he has a "winning temperament."
let's learn it
dear lester. i don't give a rat's behind about trump's tax returns.
i'm not defending him. i said he didn't push her on anything. i'd rather the hc won in a fair debate.
had to miss the show -- stuck in ct. opener? closer? how many tunes? was sure &amp; certain awesome acoustic? sorry for all the ?'s!
vote: if the was today, would you vote for...
donald is crashing, and it's sad and makes me uncomfortable.
on the upside no one can say hillary didn't smile enough during this debate
done with this walking/bus bullshit.. buying myself a car and just gonna whip it without a license
i know a lot of twitter disagrees but i think holt did a pretty decent job.
do you love it? i've always wanted to go! there's another sculpture park in jersey i want to go to also ♥️
plenty of undecideds are looking for revelations on "trust" and "character" in the debates. what a bad place to go looking...
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
i didn’t even watch the debate tonight. i’m engaged, i read lots of news and commentary from multiple perspectives.
happy birthday to the best sister out there love u
maybe they're waiting so radrev is a surprise?? but yeah i'm shocked there's not more nimrod on there!
then i came to the rescue and all was well
too many people don't spell "too" right... why?
you've lived in estell your whole life?
this happens to me once a month like whyyy
he needs to wait for the audit tho
and i think he might have a problem.
never again. if you know what that phrase means, you know how you should vote.
rush transcript -- tonight's talking points memo: "clinton vs. trump on the debate stage" --
you've got to hand it to hillary clinton. for a woman with brain damage, blood clots, dehydration, pollen problems she is as tough as nails.
absolutely will always be. fact check on your facebook see how many friends like trumps page. compared to hillary
says he's very proud he was able 2get potus' birth certificate. 2 humiliate him. "hillary couldn't bring it home."
lol fair enough, i feel like still breathing would've been great live :/
watch the presidential debate tonight in the great outdoors at la plaza cultural
doesn't constant sniffing indicate a lack of stamina?
if everyone watches this video, nobody will ever vote for hillary:
deion jones picks off a tipped pass and returns it 90 yards for a td. falcons leads 45-25 with 13:37 left in the game
finally found this old gem, missin you lots luv bug
.: exposed trump's lack of preparation, but clinton seemed over-prepared at times.
i think there's a high likelihood we see trump do something totally bonkers tomorrow to change the topic.
o u are taking about celente? i was making a joke about the other guy
doesn't constant sniffing indicate a lack of stamina?
dropped my phone straight on my face
trump golden stated that debate. he was up 3-1 and blew it.
can donald protect us from "the cyber?"
looked more intently at the tv for post debate than i did at any point during the debate
im still trying to figure out how we went from talking about nukes to rosie odonnell.
one is doing coke, the other is doing weed. it explains so much
trump didn't lose w base tonight but did he make up any ground w women that voted for romney in 2012? probably not.
i miss tweeting about fellatio.
trump: "i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary, to her family, &amp; i said to myself, 'i can't do it.…
preaching to the choir dude. please explain why being over prepared is a problem . thanks
1) debates don't select for substance, 2) it's rare that debates change significant of likely voters' minds, 3) what am i missing?
hilary's eyes must be so sore from restraining eye rolls.
it's that simple. he will be a better president than she.
clinton won this debate in part because she had more stamina for this than trump. he flagged badly after 30 minutes. she didn't.
my wonderful tlist friends....can i maybe come live with you for 4 years?
donald trump on his finances: i don't say this in a "braggadocious way”
when donald trump says he has a "winning temperament."
i love unscientific twitter polls - let's poll! who won the
trump says he's winning the "online polls" post-debate—they're "fantastic." points out there haven't been any "real polls" yet
man i'm getting flashbacks to cheering for a team with a bad defense and it's not fun
that was fun. back to cybering.
liberals see this expression as kick ass and dont get how mirthful and entitled she looks 2 everyone else. #
they were both awful. sigh
while talks, looks at her like she's a hitchhiker with pets
russia has more warheads than ever, n korea is testing nukes, and iran got a sweetheart deal to keep theirs. thanks, .
either way, i have a real question for y'all... what are you going to do after november? how will your life change because of your choice?
yes! bourbon!
she's a little too reliant on her notes
hillary supporting drone strikes in my country is why she will never have my vote
my debate headline: hillary won on points. trump won on expectations.
lmao i'm buying my ticket to canada regardless
liar liar - the hilary pants on fire song:
don't be nervous. remember she is a boss. she's smarter. she's more experienced. she is the only one actually qualified.
well it would potentially upset the illusion that your vote counts. also it's too deeply a constitutional issue.
i have never really understood why the resistance here but anyway good job !
the fact he was even on the stage after all these months makes me think his numbers will only go up after his performance tonight.
i saw this. holy shit. this fucking guy.
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
our view: clinton came out ahead after first third due to trump taking up time reacting to her criticism making him defensive.
trump compares u.s. airports to 'third world country'
one top talking point from trump spin room: clinton "robotic" "programmed" "willing to say anything." trying to emphasize preparation gap.
crazy to think that there are people who felt the way i feel right now about every election until 2008. i never want to feel this way again.
lol i showed this song 😂
donald trump is a horrible, disgusting, misogynistic human being. and half of americans love him. what is wrong with you people?
ohyeah i forgot about that. actually i felt like he directly said he wasn't paying federal taxes, yeah. hope that comes up again.
i've done lots of public speaking, some debates. staying focused is really hard. hrc did; so did holt. don't nit-pick. then there was djt.
trump's base doesn't respond to fact-checking. when he talks over you, calls you a liar, tells you to shut up. they respond to that more.
my entire feed is hillary and donald face swaps. i never thought i'd say this but... i miss the engagements and baby pictures
he really isn't but i can't stand that dude max
hi amber. great to have you with us again
the undecided vote will now move back to clinton and the trump momentum of the last two weeks will likely expire.
donald must have thought it was going to be a complete and utter wipeout
that's a wrap! let me know what you think! who won and why? i'll retweet...
"something very different" is how christie (rightly!) describes trump's performance.
yes. cause of death hasn't been released to the public yet
so, that's like a felony with the grammar police or something? can you say "bigger issues?" ;-)
is that what they are getting at? it seemed more like a temperament question: "would you throw a tantrum or lose with grace?"
i'm hearing is nailing it. is that your opinion? sounds like a reunion where u keep it movin' &amp; gotta stay tight.
sat down w/ yesterday to discuss how revisionist history of claims complicates disputes
clinton won this debate in part because she had more stamina for this than trump. he flagged badly after 30 minutes. she didn't.
done and done
more than that, he seemed to obliquely confirm it.
trump campaign was deleting multiple tweets that proved his lies during the debate. i'd laugh if it wasn't so pathetic/gross.
without me!!!!!!
and that equates to 94% how?
how soon before can run?
and you honestly think hillary is a straight shooter?
i'm not being coy. i do not understand how any sentient person can want this man to lead the country. it's incomprehensible to me.
is like crazy old guy who sits next to you on a bus, talks &amp; talks &amp; won't shut up. squishing him like a worm.
trump's drinking more water....guess he's a little nervous and maybe realizes he's way out of his league!
please tell me you not voting for him
wait... did trump whine about rosie o'donnell there at the end? does he know where he is? am i in the ninth circle of hell?
don't even stress anything. what is meant to be for you will be for you 💘
i saw the opening match and main event of and thats all...
sorry for the delayed response, matt. we do hope you got upgraded today. if not, we hope you enjoyed the flight! ^chris
i wish she didn't unlike this
i will hate on you so hard
hillary is dead wrong about iran. too bad donald is incoherent on the subject.
is this in reference to our presentation
remember when people said robert alford was bad? yeah that was a fun time.
live from the with - on throughout the night. tune in - this is amazing!
my tree will have some ripe in like 4 days. not sure you can wait that long tho...
you a real one and if someone doesn't see that then that's their fucking loss.
watch : "it does not seem like trump is going to break ground" with moderate voters &amp; women:
the sniffling!???? what is it???
i have had that bug, if its for a stand-up shot i just put the lut on the master clip
it really is just..... something...... that
twitter had a few things to say in response to 's comment about minorities "living in hell:"
yes i heard. omg we did have huge friendly arguments. many!!
holt was in hillary's camp- challenging, fact-checking trump continuously, not once challenged or fact-checked her. disgraceful.
insecure. it's a badge of honor and a sad reflection of the way so many are closed minded.
love my new kicks from ‼️
oh my goodness. a firewatch movie? awesome!!!! i hope.
i can't believe he managed to fat-shame people. that's next level douchebaggery.
there is nothing wrong w/ feeling displeased w/ both of the remaining candidates &amp; abstaining. when we stand they lose
imagine once you unblocked a number you received all the texts they tried sending you🤔
clinton campaign chair: trump "came unprepared"
on the foggy westside, getting the southern sun is usually the only way they’ll grow. ours is west-facing and only one side blooms.
most likely this weekend
the first caller on cleveland sports radio tomorrow morning will want to talk about who the should draft in 2017.
happy for you! any news on your return to the skies?
sf avg is misleading since literally every neighborhood is pricey. lots of cheaper…
if you are educated about climate change and support donald trump, you're a hypocrite
i figured owusu would be out for at least a few weeks. glad he's doing better.
i clearly despise trump. but refuses to give a or 1st 100 day plan. she sees a problem but won't truly commit.
donald trump is me, denying all the shitty things i do. even when everyone has the receipts in front of my face.
parody account
and her skin mad nice 😅
i wish it was bernie on that stage tonight!
you know what's really funny? you know trump thinks he won that debate. he'll be out this week bragging about how he won. watch.
now i can fly away from my sorrows
. on hrc's tpp 'gold standard' comment: "that was something that was said at an earlier point before the deal was negotiated."
who the hell is on your panel? i'm not even a trump supporter and it was clear trump won it!
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
almost 50k likes on the new vlog 😳
hillary and trump arguing how they'll punch iran. yay!! improvement over last election where candidates argued how they'll punch pakistan.
if i was on snapchat i would ask millenials who won. can you pass it on?
tonight, we heard from two candidates -- but only one president.
i truly thought you were above comments like this
great debate by both and . planning to vote for both!
:d that is adorable.
ok, so right as the debate started, i was getting off a flight at laguardia
this was perhaps... closer than i wanted to get
i wonder what the people who actually run the world are doing while everybody's glued to the debate
fact check: trump is telling perhaps the biggest lie of all right now, that he always opposed the invasion of iraq
"optimized for smooth streaming." i know a few details about how video can be streamed on youtube, most of which are public knowledge. 😉
at this point i'm just waiting for the snl skits that will mock this debate
i try like hate the kardashians. i do not care.
. proved once again tonight: he’s a thin-skinned bully who doesn’t care about anyone but himself.
i'm a big cs:go fan. haven't gotten into mil sims a ton before though.
lot of things i question about clinton, but her stamina ain't one. it's telling that he'd go there instead of policy issues.
only took till the 3rd quarter
no matter who wins this debate or the election. america loses.
i was annoyed at lester at first, but i realized he was attempting to make ultra-clear he showed no bias &amp; let them go
this person just called me a member of the kkk (gross) i go to respond and find i am blocked. interesting …
like the last scene in "a face in the crowd... just let the bad guy keep ranting while everybody's listening. they'll figure it out.
crazy how i used to really want this girl. convinced i won't find love.
there's a 10 person panel on cnn with 8 hillary supporters trying to convince everyone she won.
who won the first debate? follow our live coverage (watch)
we have to do another 😏😂
what is scientific about a poll with a sample size of 25?
i need to go get my passport.. cuz if hillary wins i'm gone!

day 5 and my stomach is lk poppin and my face isnt as oily i think
this is like watching two suburban parents trying to explain how high speed internet works to each other.
i'm sorry for the spam about the debate. i'll stop now. just one thing: please american followers, register to vote:
trump: "i've made great relationships over the last...little while...with african americans" also trump:
hillary clinton: "i prepared to be president, and i think that's a good thing"
was i the only one who thought eleven from stranger things was based off of lucy from elfen lied
so why are dylann roof, james holmes, still alive???? yeah i'll wait!!!
trump's website went down. politifact went down. had 1.4 million people on it &amp; is still going strong.
i always get stuck on these fucking undecided voters.
.: "[] had a real opportunity to take control of issues &amp; prove that he understood them &amp; he…
come back !!! lol
appalled by tonight's debate? afraid the next will be more of same? demand a place for on the stage!
i cant understand how a presidential candidate standing up &amp; declaring we should commit a war crime (take iraq's oil) is not disqualifying.
tell us this lie: hillary didn't fund isis &amp; she didn't delete 33k emails and bill didn't rape multitudes of women.…
who won the debate? the pundits who are paid huge money to debate who "won" the debate.
my facebook feed is full of this pretty accurate summary
as soon as i think life's getting better something happens to mess it all up.😭
why are you scared?
never stop grindin, man it's good thought right now i'm manager/part owner of a gym in the heights. when you back in htown?
hillary, for fuck's sake, he just said the country's fucked because of the iraq war - a republican endeavor! bush's war, not yours!
he just made a word! yup, thats trump.
honestly of all the bullshit takes we're going to get from men re debates, grover norquist's "what about vaping" is a breath of fresh air
"i think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her." trump on his insults of rosie o'donnell.
"whooo! okay!" *pause* hahahaha. wow, secretary clinton is on fire tonight! loving it.
who is ? put it together october 14th.
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
how can hillary say she is for jobs when she has stated she will put kentucky coal miners out of business?…
hillary doing better. fellow bernie voters -- admit it, there's nothing she's said we disagree with. in fact, she's adopted his positions!
thank you, america! this is your movement and we proved we can take america back from a crooked and corrupt system.
i agree. we can vote strategically and keep trump out of the white house.

i nearly fell off the couch! what a delusional twit. hilarious.
whaaaatttt?!? is there an option for people who don't have tvs?
says the woman who accused trump of doing drugs with zero evidence. you liberals are pure hypocrites.
true. but braggadocio is a noun, braggadocious is an adjective. noun forms usually show up earlier. (but not always.)
yes, i'm rooting for hillary. but i was ready for her to slip. i was ready to see him look calm and ready. he didn't look like a president.
does somebody have the actual written policy/program? i can't seem to find it.
tried again tonight☺️
yeah like if he where there he would be like: please don't do that
embarrassing, shocking and horrendous. but worthy of the sack? clearly, his job under threat. but i don't think it's sackable. let's see...

there was a lot of meat on the bone, from both sides left on the table.

wtf i reply
my personally conducted poll of who won tonight! donald trump 97% hillary clinton 2% 5mil polled
a rigged system is the only way you can explain lester holt asking trump about hillary's unpresidential look.
whats up, ?
david, did they broadcast a different debate in canada. he was crushed- and he shredded himself.
it's how hot it is outside right?
video: says holt did "fine job," claims his mic was "defective"
plz rt &amp; follow
to reiterate before 😴, bragged about: -taking advantage of housing crisis -not paying taxes -not paying contractors -pursuing birther claim
that's a boom!
classic “tell”: he arches his right eyebrow when he’s taken a hit. or when he’s about to insult someone. amazingly obvious.
he asked her about her emails. then he failed to follow up in any real way. it sucked.

why is so bias in favor of clinton ?

hillary clinton as the théoden of left politics is an analogy that only becomes more apt the more i ponder it.
donald trump sniffled his way through the debate, and people noticed

notice trump sniffing all the time. coke user?
serious question, is it really that bad? i've been through mississippi... comparable?
.: "i thought [] was strong on jobs and the economy." …
what's the chance that trump backs out of the other debates?
he was in prepared.
missed most of the debate. playing catch up via twitter.
make a sign that says deport trump and hang it up
hey straight white guys, if you're amazed that clinton is keeping her cool right now, remember that women practice it all day, every day.
nbc, which is owned by comcast, will never change as long as we just bitch about lester hold but keep paying our $150/cable bill.
well there's also the fact he lives here

like we haven't seen what that leads to... lol

serious question, is it really that bad? i've been through mississippi... comparable?
what's not?
mannnnn miggy said it not me why u gotta do me hella dirty 😂
iphone 6s camera vs iphone 7 camera 😰...jesus christ
trump says he "regrets" not bringing up bill clinton's affairs during the debate. jesus christ! this guy is insane!
per , giuliani says in spin room that trump was going to talk about monica and impeachment but didn't bc chelsea was in audience.
best argument tonight: trump had 3+ months to prepare for this and gave no care to do so. its embarrassing and disrespectful.
clinton's 35-point win in the cnn post-debate poll is the 3rd largest margin ever, after romney-obama i and clinton-bush 92 townhall.
when will the 1st philly show be released? can't wait to hear the fever!!
first debate lived up to expectations -- a noisy clash -- but it may not change trajectory of race, writes
finally on the iphone 6 game 😂
opinion: this time, trump’s interruptions, insults and insinuations can’t save him by
kind of like bill settled out of court to avoid being found guilty of sexual harassment?
