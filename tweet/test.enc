trump showed some restraint on the dig at his father, but i'm not sure he can hold back all night.
give me a break with those trade deals with china. you are the first one who makes your cheap stuff made in china!!
hillary has dominated the first 15 minutes. trump is out of his league. wow

folks love his bullshit tho
trump keeps literally sniffling. allergies? so sad. someone get him a tissue.

is anyone counting how many times trump says china and mexico tonight?

lester holt: 'anything happen while i was in the bathroom?'
here's a prediction: debate analysts will remark that hillary was too stiff, know-it-all, and smug.
hillary is the soccer mom that wants to be chill with her girls but her 5yr old keeps bugging her and she's about to loose it.
she's the one who counts her years as first lady as part of her "experience"
you don't have to love hillary, but you've gotta give her credit for being prepared tonight.
what do think of this
what is up with this interrupting ?!?!
where'd you get it? i've been trying to get my hands on one for a while now but i haven't gotten any luck :(
hilllary clinton supported tpp before she opposed it. reminds me of senator john kerry.
. channels john kerry on trade: she was for bad trade deals before she was against them.
he's already losing it.
sheesh. the crowd to watch the debate is literally pouring outside of
trump is bullying her on stage right now
at most 80% of students who won tickets to the debate know nothing about politics. it should have been a selection process. utter bs.
especially in the south, and in rural areas where people tend to talk more slowly. clinton is talking about as quickly as you can talk.
on the west side.

i'm no fan of trump but you are being obtuse if you really think that.
yep. just crashed!!!

why does trump keep interrupting? lester where are you?!!!
no don't bring poor ronnie into this
the first thing out of hillary's mouth tonight should have been "donald trump's plan is only going to help people like donald trump"
donald trump may live in his own reality‚Äîbut we've got his own words right here. check them out:

twitch should stream this debate can you imagine twitch chat during this shit show?
and, i shit you not, donald‚Äôs website is down. l o fucking l
hillary's eyes are going off-center. he's getting to her hard.
what do your taxes have to do with emails? deflect, deflect, deflect!
why does trump's tax returns have anything to do with deleted emails?
a clinton economy = more taxes and more spending!
more than once
the dog ate my tax returns
obama didn't pitch the proper tent.
emails. take a shot!!!
people that make things complex most of the time have no idea what they are doing.. üòÑ
they were told to stay silent! wtf?!
i want to see hillary's speeches.
is lester even part of this debate?
time..anyone???
very clear in the first 2 minutes that donald trump is not prepared.

in tonight's main, i'm hoping for a double deletion between trump &amp; clinton..they're both obsolete. give me 2 new candidates.
omg i was living for the barn lib debate tweets
great visuals! you always do amazing work.
watch the under bite. when he's irritated and spinning, it becomes more pronounced. it's tremendous. yuge even.
this is my favorite tweet so far
clinton: maybe trump won't release tax returns because he doesn't want people to know "he's paid nothing."
"that makes me smart" says trump about failing to pay taxes for troops, vets, roads and making america great again.
where your tax return is?? do reply to this question!!

hillary's permanent fixed smug patronising grin not going to help her.
notice how trump hasn't denied any of hillary's allegations regarding his taxes
they got internet here. barely.
"if your main claim to be president is your business, we should talk about that."
he's probably talked a solid 25% more than her
let‚Äôs note that trump did not deny not paying people he was contracted to pay
i thought jfk airport was rather nice.
clinton is going hard on the accusations-but i can't tell if it's gaining traction. seems hard to take seriously, with her scandals looming.
yeah but washington politicians have a reputation of being snakes
man, do i need to stick up for the jfk jetblue terminal?
he's never been to seattle, dallas love field, or denver.
serious question.... what's the sh*ttiest airport in the u.s.?
being fiscally conservative is "bad for government". tell me again why we're 20 trillion in federal debt again, hill.

if trump performs poorly in a debate, all it does is lower the bar for him to compare his rate of improvement until november.

hillary: race is a significant challenge in our country. we have a lot of work to do. lester: mr trump you have 2 minutes. trump: i'm black.
oh oh here we go
hillary clinton: "fact-checkers, get to work"
it is silent in for the first time all night while clinton is taking about race. you can feel the anxiety and hope here.
trump is rambling; when hillary answers slowly, it conveys steadiness. good for her, bad look for trump.
this election cycle has been one slow, painful sob into my whiskey glass as i gradually steel myself to vote for clinton.

stop and frisk is unconditional.
her answer is mediocre at best. not surprising. a condemnation of private prisons would be too much to ask.
trump says we need more " stop and fisk" to fix racial divide.

the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u.s. manufacturing non-competitive.
if your lawyer is telling you not to release your tax returns that tells me you are definitely hiding something.

was trump's debate prep a bindle?
remember when trump said that hillary‚Äôs happiness was very important to him? remember? that was super weird.
i literally think trump has never had to listen to a woman for this long in his life.
those bullets could go through somebody and hit one of my buildings!
i have to admit to everyone, sitting here and seeing fernandez pitching for the is very emotional, and eerie.
t minus 2 hours 20 min

he's sniffing more than bowie on cavett in '74.
for you. you're already on her side.
i honestly love it so much it's on repeat 24/7
stop and frisk opened for hall and oates at the greek theater last week.
lol i was like someone has to he talking about this. this is nuts!
trump seems a little ...flustered, while discussing race in america.
ok so a question regarding audiobooks: can you multitask while listening? and if so, is there a limit on what kind of tasks you can perform?
she is much better than i. i would match whatever depth of low he wants to fight at.
who won round 2 of the debate? our experts weigh in and render their verdicts:
i'll hit you up tomorrow
this is the simple fact about : she is a typical politician - all talk, no action.
i'm not joking. how can any educated person vote for this guy?
i'm hearing is nailing it. is that your opinion? sounds like a reunion where u keep it movin' &amp; gotta stay tight.

nah no worries i put it in a bad spot lmao
did trump just say that he did obama a favor helping race relations? or is my simulation glitching again?

hillary is basically saying that all americans are "implicitly racist." that's offensive and is going to hurt her.
no, don't encourage it! he's supposed to be impartial. if he interferes a lot, the debate will seem tilted in clinton's favor.
no one was caring about birtherism because it wasn't true!
oop! hillary clinton coming with receipts tonight
i feel like the sniff is like a tell? like he sniffs right before he tells a huge lie.
trumps law and order and community relations message is way more coherent than hillary's gun control message.

yes, but the anti-trump campaign can't let getting the facts wrong go beyond trump himself.

so you're telling me that this is the best we got america? 2 bullshit artists that are not going to change a thing.

not funny, a down cow is a big deal
watch her come outta no where and steal the mic like kanye üòÇ
one of the two candidates for the most powerful job on earth can barely complete a coherent sentence. how did we get here?
did trump almost just say that he was endorsed by isis?!
me waiting for trump to say something intelligent
"i prepared for being president and i think that's a good thing." mic drop.
actually did say that and when she said it he shook his head no. when talks about admiral endorsements,
now it's cyber security &amp; putin. but what strikes me is her vitality. she is not wallowing in physical weakness. she's tough. here he comes
for a second i thought trump said he was endorsed by isis, and i did not even blink an eye.
"endorsed by ice" oh, that'll endear trump to milliions i'm sure
haha and you just happened to be people watching and put two and two together and came up with five lol
hillary can't handle this debate. he is eating her up.

he's been doing it for a while!
i really hope snl is new this weekend.

things trump has not denied: paying no taxes stiffing contractors racist corporate policy

cherry picking stats is fun. 500k increase in stops from 2003 to 2011 brought in 176 additional guns.
got damn right
i have a daughter who's two and so good with computers. and i wouldn't want her to have a president who looks down on women
good hit by trump on debbie wasserman schultz.
guys you gotta hand it to trump, he didn't discriminate when he built an apartment in a town that is 96% white
. is the drunkest human in america right now --&gt;
why is donald sniffing so much?
donald trump: our cyber is the best. the best. it's so cyber. so cyber. the best. in regards to the cyber, it could also be a 400-pound man.
brb, going to take a nap for the next four years
that silly squidward/wayne meme
i have a son. he is so good with computers it's unbelievable.
i just said the same thing!!
i genuinely feel like i'm watching bad tv, not a "presidential" debate. alarming.
are you even listening? lol. he won this debate easily. you literally have no clue what your talking about lol.
hillary scratches nose for second time
this debate.
i just get very frustrated with trump's constant commentary during clinton's 2 minutes. they should really just tur‚Ä¶
harry, cmon. people ought to start calling her the surgeon. she's so sharp. she's slicing and dicing him.
as someone who was co-president of an anime club, i can confirm
thoughts so far?
getting all emotional. so proud of our hrc. she's is doing amazing.
nothing gets me more tight than when i talk about this election with someone and when i ask them if they voted they say "oh no i didn't bc-"
love you bro‚ù§Ô∏è
everyone go follow my crazy talented and creative best friend
listening to talk about isis - note deep inhalation and nose rub (of course,
i know i'm not the only one who heard trump catch himself by saying " i'm endorsed by is- "

if there's any justice, history will be unkind to &amp; for their shameful opposition to peace in colombia
holt: re birtherism: "what do u say to african-american community?" trump: "i say nothing....i did country &amp; president a great service." oy.
this fact-checking is on it
trump's favorite tv shows: law &amp; order and my 600-lb life
.: "we should've taken the oil."
nato being the "longest military alliance in the history of the world" cannot be true, hillary.
"a very against police judge." a presidential candidate just used that phrase. he has great words.
could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds...
check out 's tweet:
tonight i learned if you say "wrong" into a microphone three times, you win a debate.
yes ice. lord help us.
man i want yo say something funny but this ain't funny man. this shit is not funny at all.
tfw you want to stress eat all the garlic knots because of
ok, hillary has got to stop outsourcing fact checking! just say "you cant take the oil: its in the ground"
good work bro :))
good news: if you elect trump, you also get his 10 year old kid. he can handle the cyber.
his hair is crazy... just crazy
you are on a roll in twitter today! i am loving this debate and the total lack of focus by one debater!
hopefully, when you're there, your colleagues would be of equal merit.
after a brief poll of the internet, i've settled on gin.
true! about why we had to leave iraq. our troops would have been in serious danger
it always comes down to money with this man. it's all he knows.
donald would solve cyber by appointing craig wright to uscybercom
my twitter: 50% debate analysis and recap 50% people giggling about the word cyber
where's all the white male pundit concern about donald trump's health? with this crazy sniffle? hmmmmm?
i feel like he has spent a lot of time this debate explaining old crazy shit he did or said while she is just calming blinking at it all
perkins has a character select screen! sold!
when people say isn't going after americans' guns...
i hope joe biden shows up like a wrestler coming back from an injury.
you think we may be able to know before eod?
fair enough. i agree it is still up. the fact that he contradicts so often is just striking, yeah?
dummy lol. democrats were main people in the kkk and fought against freeing the slaves..be proud of that.
lester holt, war monger: "who's behind it? how do we fight it?"
donald trump: "i have common sense" me: *donald trump voice* "wrong"
"i have investments in charlotte"
he should blow his nose. he‚Äôs already blown the debate.
i am thrilled to see a woman in a general election presidential debate. my mother thrilled üòÜ
wanna know what shouldn't have happened, trump? you tryna become president!
odd how wrong trump is about crime in the city he lives in. declined, so did murders. cc‚Ä¶
how does hillary not laugh at some of the stupid stuff donald trump is saying?
it's cool you acknowledged that &amp; deleted thanks
who is sean hannidy?
how long are you home for?
...most of the time they go over their allotted time and they get cut out abruptly near the end. is there a way to record over..
somebody call sean hannity and see if he's okay!
i mean, i don't love when he talks ever. but those times are less bad
nothing could sum up my feelings on all this better
charlotte vs. sasha again
did the audience just laugh at trump saying "i have a better temperament" ?
oh my god hillary just stared straight ahead the entire time, into the soul of america, pleading us to be intelligent
watch the "undecided" line when hillary talks vs. when trump talks. trump is really winning tonight.
okay but seriously guys all joking aside: when are we going to get serious about cyber
i swear i just heard donald say "i was endorsed by isis". he also said "very very" and "beautiful" and "i" a lot.
but when trouble cones in their backyard they expect us to foot the bill. they agreed to the alliance they should be all in.
like many, i was willing to listen. i will go checkout his website, i guess.
lmao man i been laughing every since i tuned in
clinton said trump‚Äôs birtherism was part of ‚Äúa long record‚Äù of ‚Äúracist behavior.‚Äù he called her ‚Äúholier than thou.‚Äù
"i have much better temperament than her." this just crossed the line into high comedy.
stickering doesn't bother me. i get into a rhythm and enjoy it. although it's redundant, it's not too bad. can't wait to play!
we should ashamed that this man has been allowed to get this close to the white house. not a coherent policy. not a coherent thought.
yeah, let's go talk to that totally objective and non-partisan paragon of journalistic integrity, sean hannity.
thank god there's only 9 minutes left. trump has just lied the whole time.
he's terrible
"call sean hannity" is his only defense here. and its new. we just started hearing that claim more this past few weeks.
hello!!! why are you allowing him to ramble?! wake up!!
neither candidate is a good choice.
my beer is already all gone how did this happen
the thing that scares me is i felt that way watching george w debate. and look what happened. twice. üò´üá±üá∑

this is sounding like i should take the next flight out to trinidad lol
it's a ghost town in streets of
i don't know, maybe, probably, essentially, totally, yeeeaaahhh.
hillary is getting knocked for having "male" attributes of being stoic and shrewd and intelligent and manipulative
all the heavy mattress hitters have gone to mexico and who is defending the mattresses in japan
this debate's painful to watch, donald not making any sense &amp; hillary clearly lying, we need to get in there
although the entire world is considered to have consented to neoliberalism, it doesn't make it inevitable.
uh oh. just fatshamed hackers
.: barack obama is your president too.
someone should buzz lester and let him know he can challenge hillary like he has trump.
the inner cities. the african americans. üòÇüòÇ
and hillary manages to call her donald every time.
being realistic here, if trump becomes president he's gonna get assasinated, and hillary is fucking stupid so it's a lose-lose situation
add your name now to join the millions of americans who are with hillary all the way to the white house!
he hasn't said any of his policies

its a mess he isnt even answering wuestions
trying to think what it would take to get me to hang out with trump. you know, at a bar, just chatting over a beer or two.
hillary empty rhetoricüò°take out isis?üôÑur 2 busy wanting these ppl 2 enterüá∫üá∏without vettingüëéüèª‚Ä¶
clinton keeps asking the fact checkers to do her job. why isn't she calling trump out more?
what the hell is this cable hack message on tv screen smh wow lol how do they do it , this is cray cray !
as a woman, this feels so personal b/c i've felt this sort condescension from men before.
gary johnson and william weld are looking pretty good to me right now. :-)
oh, amy, you expect civility &amp; respect from him? üòâ
trump: "as far as the nuclear is concerned--i agree..." (whew! was worried there for a sec...)
second time the captions have said ‚Äúanna nicole smith.‚Äù
he has too much education to act that way. his alma mater is probably frowning
trump's biggest liability in this debate isn't that his ideas are bonkers; it's that he can't speak in complete, coherent sentences.
can't think of a tougher name in baseball than barraclough.
. to : "no wonder you've been fighting isis your entire adult life."
"the only secret is he has no plan" is a really weak line
would literally chop of a limb to see that
she's actually supporting that disastrous iran deal.
un freaking believable.

yea, i can see that being a pain. i pull 6 stickers off at a time, stuck on my fingers and jam them out quick.

are really just in human nature... religion for the most part seems to be really hypocritical, illogical, and leaves too many questions.
where upstate?
your avi is gorgeous
ya!!! sometimes i get into a tizzy and i'm like what have i done the past week and feel this need to keep a record
obviously i live in something of vacuum/echo chamber of well-educated urban fags and all, but does anyone think trump is doing well tonight?
lester holt seems to be cross-examining trump, but not doing the same with hillary...
&gt; on "stamina"
"it's not nice!" trump talks like he's six years old.
in benghazi and the fact she wants to focus on trumps taxes and not actual country issues
hillary rolls around in the mud.
hold on... are you saying trump doesn't lie?!?!
clinton has done a good job tonight. anyone who says otherwise is a bald faced liar
blue jays lose, tigers lose. orioles are now one game back of the wild card, and have a two game lead for the wild card.
//can't fucking read without my glasses shit
he‚Äôs gonna tweet a lot of things.
hillary so flustered she plugging her book..
paralipsis ftw!! he was gonna be a jerk but decided not to -- what a gentleman.
good i believe that also..but the part about what party is racist..brainwashed
as soon as the debate ended someone popped a champagne bottle next door lmao
oh look, a toxic twitter tl. saw that one coming a million miles away.
i'm sure you'll be ready soon and you'll do a great job
i'm only watching this tripe because my son wanted to see it for his constitutional studies at school.
trump couldn't even make it through this debate! stamina my ass
wait, the next debate is in vegas? in my city!?? i'll be there!!
‚Äúthis is not a nice thing‚Äù
trump talked way too much about his feelings he must be on his period
decided to watch ; i have bourbon though.
will be on next to share my reaction to tonight's .
i think we've been hard on that was a tough job! maybe he remained too calm. but one must remember trump makes it hard
um, to bug him?
as long as alleys stays open idec who becomes president
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
our view: clinton came out ahead after first third due to trump taking up time reacting to her criticism making him defensive.
almost every girl
that teixeira stare and bat flip why did no one tell me about it
not sure which is more grody.
huge applause when trump says he is winning without spending anywhere near the same money on ads!
clinton wasn‚Äôt great. but she was definitely better than trump.
enzo and cass!
what you missed at the trump-clinton debate
. proved once again tonight: he‚Äôs a thin-skinned bully who doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself.

hey babe lets spice things up tonight and watch fox new's recap of the living nightmare that just aired.
"hundreds of millions of ads"
excited for my grandkids to ask if i voted for trump and then i'll say no and feel good about myself.
daaang, trump was not gonna shake his hand. but clinton was like 'wassap?!' hand shake!
slightly surprised no mention of benghazi from trump.
if you don't believe lost look at his body language &amp; that of his family after the debate. the clinton's are greeting crowd
i don't think a politician has ever once made their point within the debate time limit
yay! isn't just for shoots and parties, you can host meet ups here too. great c‚Ä¶
i don't care for either candidate üò´ what do we do???
who do you feel had the best tonight? (note: non-scientific poll)
they told the seamless woman they didnt have any drivers so my food has just been sitting there....ok....so she refunded me and gave me
one thing she got right was not to get too much hyperbolic over trump's ridiculous reactions
"i was gunna say something horrible, i really wanted to, but i'm a nice guy"
who cares about 's birth certificate? who cares? terrorism, immigration, economy.
tom brokaw said people troubled by black on black crime lmao who he talking about? white people!!!
here comes helping hillary. can't stand her.
didn't invite the mother of my child to a baby shower you all were trying to throw for me ‚ÄºÔ∏è? you all must have lost your damn minds ,,,üôãüèø
clinton helped lead the charge into libya + iraq. trump supported the iraq war. neither has the judgment.
rsvp: for free entry before 3pm and reduced admission after.
oh fuck all y'all. i did this for a living for 20 years. i argued on the record with middle-aged white men. she crushed it.
btw, looks like punk took event's advice and haven't been on
i am a woman who will never vote for hillary clinton. she doesn't represent me.
who woudlve thought rosie odonnell would be mentioned in a presidential debate?
trump family pow-wow in the back of the stage while the clinton family greets the crowd -- amazing image.
what? other way around
i'm so tempted to ball tonight but so nervous on how my ankle will hold up. i miss it :(
sry for me snap but i'm snap but i'm not have a good one
i've never in my lifetime seen babbling incoherence on a presidential debate stage like trump is displaying tonight. i'm in a nightmare.
i need a long shower.
does anyone out there think trump won that? serious q
curious that under no circumstances does trump criticize russia. everyone else gets smeared without hesitation. non-disparagement clause?
about last night
echofox how exactly do you drop a map to muffin lightning.
she was very good, so prepared and actually funny. he was incompetent, never replied to questions asked and sniffing no stop.
oh, it's over? is it over? everyone register to vote! please vote! this is terrifying!! we are terrified!
you are on!
let me tell you of the age of aol
donald should go take a nap, he looked so frazzled and exhausted ‚Äì does anyone have a chair with a pillow maybe?

i'm thinking the champ won, no?
our politics were already somewhat absurd but to have it merge the style of reality television is just too much.
trump started well with creating jobs and then just lost the plot afterwards

do you agree with 's comment on ?
well, i'm happy that you found a candidate that represents you!
john elliott x gap gq collection available now!! early links!!
interesting note for tonight‚Äôs debate, there was not one question about immigration.
by the way, there's a much more solid version of a trump argument against clinton on iraq if he just stopped insisting he was a visionary
doing some epic color coding to keep track of character arcs! üìö
when donald trump says he has a "winning temperament."
let's learn it
dear lester. i don't give a rat's behind about trump's tax returns.
i'm not defending him. i said he didn't push her on anything. i'd rather the hc won in a fair debate.
had to miss the show -- stuck in ct. opener? closer? how many tunes? was sure &amp; certain awesome acoustic? sorry for all the ?'s!
vote: if the was today, would you vote for...
donald is crashing, and it's sad and makes me uncomfortable.
on the upside no one can say hillary didn't smile enough during this debate
done with this walking/bus bullshit.. buying myself a car and just gonna whip it without a license
i know a lot of twitter disagrees but i think holt did a pretty decent job.
do you love it? i've always wanted to go! there's another sculpture park in jersey i want to go to also ‚ô•Ô∏è
plenty of undecideds are looking for revelations on "trust" and "character" in the debates. what a bad place to go looking...
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
i didn‚Äôt even watch the debate tonight. i‚Äôm engaged, i read lots of news and commentary from multiple perspectives.
happy birthday to the best sister out there love u
maybe they're waiting so radrev is a surprise?? but yeah i'm shocked there's not more nimrod on there!
then i came to the rescue and all was well
too many people don't spell "too" right... why?
you've lived in estell your whole life?
this happens to me once a month like whyyy
he needs to wait for the audit tho
and i think he might have a problem.
never again. if you know what that phrase means, you know how you should vote.
rush transcript -- tonight's talking points memo: "clinton vs. trump on the debate stage" --
you've got to hand it to hillary clinton. for a woman with brain damage, blood clots, dehydration, pollen problems she is as tough as nails.
absolutely will always be. fact check on your facebook see how many friends like trumps page. compared to hillary
says he's very proud he was able 2get potus' birth certificate. 2 humiliate him. "hillary couldn't bring it home."
lol fair enough, i feel like still breathing would've been great live :/
watch the presidential debate tonight in the great outdoors at la plaza cultural
doesn't constant sniffing indicate a lack of stamina?
if everyone watches this video, nobody will ever vote for hillary:
deion jones picks off a tipped pass and returns it 90 yards for a td. falcons leads 45-25 with 13:37 left in the game
finally found this old gem, missin you lots luv bug
.: exposed trump's lack of preparation, but clinton seemed over-prepared at times.
i think there's a high likelihood we see trump do something totally bonkers tomorrow to change the topic.
o u are taking about celente? i was making a joke about the other guy
doesn't constant sniffing indicate a lack of stamina?
dropped my phone straight on my face
trump golden stated that debate. he was up 3-1 and blew it.
can donald protect us from "the cyber?"
looked more intently at the tv for post debate than i did at any point during the debate
im still trying to figure out how we went from talking about nukes to rosie odonnell.
one is doing coke, the other is doing weed. it explains so much
trump didn't lose w base tonight but did he make up any ground w women that voted for romney in 2012? probably not.
i miss tweeting about fellatio.
trump: "i was going to say something extremely rough to hillary, to her family, &amp; i said to myself, 'i can't do it.‚Ä¶
preaching to the choir dude. please explain why being over prepared is a problem . thanks
1) debates don't select for substance, 2) it's rare that debates change significant of likely voters' minds, 3) what am i missing?
hilary's eyes must be so sore from restraining eye rolls.
it's that simple. he will be a better president than she.
clinton won this debate in part because she had more stamina for this than trump. he flagged badly after 30 minutes. she didn't.
my wonderful tlist friends....can i maybe come live with you for 4 years?
donald trump on his finances: i don't say this in a "braggadocious way‚Äù
when donald trump says he has a "winning temperament."
i love unscientific twitter polls - let's poll! who won the
trump says he's winning the "online polls" post-debate‚Äîthey're "fantastic." points out there haven't been any "real polls" yet
man i'm getting flashbacks to cheering for a team with a bad defense and it's not fun
that was fun. back to cybering.
liberals see this expression as kick ass and dont get how mirthful and entitled she looks 2 everyone else. #
they were both awful. sigh
while talks, looks at her like she's a hitchhiker with pets
russia has more warheads than ever, n korea is testing nukes, and iran got a sweetheart deal to keep theirs. thanks, .
either way, i have a real question for y'all... what are you going to do after november? how will your life change because of your choice?
yes! bourbon!
she's a little too reliant on her notes
hillary supporting drone strikes in my country is why she will never have my vote
my debate headline: hillary won on points. trump won on expectations.
lmao i'm buying my ticket to canada regardless
liar liar - the hilary pants on fire song:
don't be nervous. remember she is a boss. she's smarter. she's more experienced. she is the only one actually qualified.
well it would potentially upset the illusion that your vote counts. also it's too deeply a constitutional issue.
i have never really understood why the resistance here but anyway good job !
the fact he was even on the stage after all these months makes me think his numbers will only go up after his performance tonight.
i saw this. holy shit. this fucking guy.
nothing on emails. nothing on the corrupt clinton foundation. and nothing on .
our view: clinton came out ahead after first third due to trump taking up time reacting to her criticism making him defensive.
trump compares u.s. airports to 'third world country'
one top talking point from trump spin room: clinton "robotic" "programmed" "willing to say anything." trying to emphasize preparation gap.
crazy to think that there are people who felt the way i feel right now about every election until 2008. i never want to feel this way again.
lol i showed this song üòÇ
donald trump is a horrible, disgusting, misogynistic human being. and half of americans love him. what is wrong with you people?
ohyeah i forgot about that. actually i felt like he directly said he wasn't paying federal taxes, yeah. hope that comes up again.
i've done lots of public speaking, some debates. staying focused is really hard. hrc did; so did holt. don't nit-pick. then there was djt.
trump's base doesn't respond to fact-checking. when he talks over you, calls you a liar, tells you to shut up. they respond to that more.
my entire feed is hillary and donald face swaps. i never thought i'd say this but... i miss the engagements and baby pictures
he really isn't but i can't stand that dude max
hi amber. great to have you with us again
the undecided vote will now move back to clinton and the trump momentum of the last two weeks will likely expire.
donald must have thought it was going to be a complete and utter wipeout
that's a wrap! let me know what you think! who won and why? i'll retweet...
"something very different" is how christie (rightly!) describes trump's performance.
yes. cause of death hasn't been released to the public yet
so, that's like a felony with the grammar police or something? can you say "bigger issues?" ;-)
is that what they are getting at? it seemed more like a temperament question: "would you throw a tantrum or lose with grace?"
i'm hearing is nailing it. is that your opinion? sounds like a reunion where u keep it movin' &amp; gotta stay tight.
sat down w/ yesterday to discuss how revisionist history of claims complicates disputes
clinton won this debate in part because she had more stamina for this than trump. he flagged badly after 30 minutes. she didn't.
done and done
more than that, he seemed to obliquely confirm it.
trump campaign was deleting multiple tweets that proved his lies during the debate. i'd laugh if it wasn't so pathetic/gross.
without me!!!!!!
and that equates to 94% how?
how soon before can run?
and you honestly think hillary is a straight shooter?
i'm not being coy. i do not understand how any sentient person can want this man to lead the country. it's incomprehensible to me.
is like crazy old guy who sits next to you on a bus, talks &amp; talks &amp; won't shut up. squishing him like a worm.
trump's drinking more water....guess he's a little nervous and maybe realizes he's way out of his league!
please tell me you not voting for him
wait... did trump whine about rosie o'donnell there at the end? does he know where he is? am i in the ninth circle of hell?
don't even stress anything. what is meant to be for you will be for you üíò
i saw the opening match and main event of and thats all...
sorry for the delayed response, matt. we do hope you got upgraded today. if not, we hope you enjoyed the flight! ^chris
i wish she didn't unlike this
i will hate on you so hard
hillary is dead wrong about iran. too bad donald is incoherent on the subject.
is this in reference to our presentation
remember when people said robert alford was bad? yeah that was a fun time.
live from the with - on throughout the night. tune in - this is amazing!
my tree will have some ripe in like 4 days. not sure you can wait that long tho...
you a real one and if someone doesn't see that then that's their fucking loss.
watch : "it does not seem like trump is going to break ground" with moderate voters &amp; women:
the sniffling!???? what is it???
i have had that bug, if its for a stand-up shot i just put the lut on the master clip
it really is just..... something...... that
twitter had a few things to say in response to 's comment about minorities "living in hell:"
yes i heard. omg we did have huge friendly arguments. many!!
holt was in hillary's camp- challenging, fact-checking trump continuously, not once challenged or fact-checked her. disgraceful.
insecure. it's a badge of honor and a sad reflection of the way so many are closed minded.
love my new kicks from ‚ÄºÔ∏è
oh my goodness. a firewatch movie? awesome!!!! i hope.
i can't believe he managed to fat-shame people. that's next level douchebaggery.
there is nothing wrong w/ feeling displeased w/ both of the remaining candidates &amp; abstaining. when we stand they lose
